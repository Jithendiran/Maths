# Chapter 2: Arithmetic

## Addition
### What is addition?
Addition means putting things together. It answers the question: "How many in total?"
**Symbol : +**

### How it works?
Let's say you have 2 sticks. Each stick is represented as: `| |`  
Now you found one more stick: `|`  
Put them all together: `||` + `|` =`|`  

In number way: `2+1 = 3`

### Read worl example  
* You have 2 pencils. Your friend gives you 4 more. Now you have 6 pencils.
* 3 apples in one basket, 5 in another → total 8 apples.

### Negative numbers
**Addition Sign Rules:**  
Operation Logic: Add means, add more gain or add more loss
| First Number (Start) | Second Number (Add) | Operation Logic        | Result Sign                | Example            |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `+` (I have)         | `+` (I gain more)   | `+ + +` → Add values   | `+` (positive)             | `3 + 5 = +8`       |
| `+` (I have)         | `-` (I lose some)   | `+ + (-)` → Subtract   | Depends on which is bigger | `5 + (-2) = +3`    |
| `-` (I owe)          | `+` (I gain some)   | `- + +` → Subtract     | Depends on which is bigger | `(-2) + 5 = +3`    |
| `-` (I owe)          | `-` (I owe more)    | `- + (-)` → Add values | `-` (negative)             | `(-3) + (-4) = -7` |

## Subtraction
### What is subtraction?
Subtraction means taking away. It answers: "How much is left?"  
**Symbol: -**  

### How it works?
If you have 5 sticks:  `|||||`  
And take away 2 sticks:`||`  
you're left with      :`  |||`  

In number way: `5-2 = 3`

### Read world example
* You had 5 chocolates. You gave 2 to your friend. Now you have 3 left.
* Bank account has ₹100, you spend ₹30 → ₹70 remains

### Negative numbers

Operation Logic: Sub means, take away gain or take away loss

| First Number (Start) | Second Number (Take Away) | Operation Logic      | Result Sign                | Example            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `+` (I have)         | `+` (I lose)              | `+ - +` → Subtract   | Depends on which is bigger | `5 - 2 = +3`       |
| `+` (I have)         | `+` (I lose more)         | `+ - +` → Subtract   | Depends on which is bigger | `2 - 5 = -3`       |
| `+` (I have)         | `-` (Remove a debt)       | `+ - (-)` → `+ +`    | Positive                   | `5 - (-3) = +8`    |
| `-` (I owe)          | `+` (Owe more)            | `- - +` → Add values | Negative                   | `(-3) - 2 = -5`    |
| `-` (I owe)          | `-` (Debt is cancelled)   | `- - (-)` → `- +`    | Depends on which is bigger | `(-5) - (-2) = -3` |

why `+ - (-)` → `+ +` ?  
 i have 5 rs, i owe 3 rupees, this can be written as +5, -3  
 here we are doing subract   
 (+5) - (-3) It is like subracting owing, so it is actually gain  
 +5 + 3 = 8

## Multiplication
### What is multiplication?
Multiplication means repeated addition. 
**Symbol : * or x**  

### How it works?
2 × 4 means adding 4 two times:  
`4 = | | | |`, `2 = | |`, for each `|` in 2, include all `|` in 4    
so,  
for 1st `|` in 2  
 = `| | | |`   
for 2nd `|` in 2  
 = `| | | |`  
Now add all them   
= `| | | |` + `| | | |` = `| | | | | | | |`  

In number way: `4x2 = 8`  

### Read worl example            
* 3 boxes with 5 mangoes each = 3 × 5 = 15 mangoes
* 4 weeks of 7 days = 4 × 7 = 28 days

| `+` (face right → +ve)   | `−` (repeat backward)  | Move backward                 | `−`          | Face +ve, walk backward → go left → result is negative  |
| `−` (face left → −ve)    | `+` (repeat forward)   | Move backward                 | `−`          | Face −ve, walk forward → go left → result is negative   |
| `−` (face left → −ve)    | `−` (repeat backward)  | Move forward (double reverse) | `+`          | Face −ve, walk backward → go right → result is positive |

| Expression | Direction (First No.) | Steps (Second No.) | Path Taken    | Result |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------ |
| `+3 × +2`  | Face right            | 2 steps forward    | `0 → +3 → +6` | `+6`   |
| `+3 × −2`  | Face right            | 2 steps backward   | `0 → −3 → −6` | `−6`   |
| `−3 × +2`  | Face left             | 2 steps forward    | `0 → −3 → −6` | `−6`   |
| `−3 × −2`  | Face left             | 2 steps backward   | `0 → +3 → +6` | `+6`   |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `+` (Gain ₹3)         | `+` (2 times)                | `+ × +` → Gain repeated        | `+`         | `+3 × +2 = +6` | Gaining ₹3 two times                  |
| `+` (Gain ₹3)         | `-` (2 times loss)           | `+ × −` → Loss repeated        | `−`         | `+3 × −2 = −6` | Losing ₹3 two times                   |
| `−` (Owe ₹3)          | `+` (2 times)                | `− × +` → Owe repeated         | `−`         | `−3 × +2 = −6` | Borrowing ₹3 two times                |
| `−` (Owe ₹3)          | `−` (2 times debt cancelled) | `− × −` → Double cancel = Gain | `+`         | `−3 × −2 = +6` | Debt of ₹3 cancelled two times → gain |


**Memory trick**: Same signs = Positive, Different signs = Negative

## Division
### What is division?
Division means splitting or grouping. It answers:
* How many groups?
* How many in each group?  
**Symbol : / or %**

### How it works?
Say you have 6 sticks: `| | | | | | |`  
You want to divide them into 2 equal groups. You put one stick in each group repeatedly:  
```
Group 1: | | |
Group 2: | | |
```
so: `6 / 2 = 3`  
Say you have 7 sticks: `| | | | | | | |`  

A box can hold max of 2 sticks, how many pair it makes?

`[||], [||], [||], [|]`  
3 box is full and 1 box is half, so 3.5  
so: `7 / 2 = 3.5 or 3 1/2`  

### Read worl example        
* Sharing 12 pizzas among 4 people, each gets 3 pizzas     
* 100 km journey in 2 hours, speed is 50 km/hour
