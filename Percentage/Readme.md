# Chapter 6: Percentage

## What is percentage?
A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100.  
The word "percent" comes from the Latin phrase per centum, which literally means "by the hundred" or "out of one hundred."

**Key concepts of percentage**

* *Fraction of 100*: 25% means $\frac{25}{100}$ (25 out of 100).  
* *The Whole*: The entire amount or total is always represented by 100%. If you have 100% of a pizza, you have the whole pizza  
* *Decimal Connection*: Percentages can easily be converted to decimals by dividing by 100 (or moving the decimal point two places to the left).  
- 50% = $\frac{50}{100}$ = 0.50
- 10% = $\frac{10}{100}$ = 0.10

## Why Use Percentages?
Percentages make it easy to compare quantities by giving them a common base: 100.
Imagine comparing the effectiveness of two medications.   
* Drug A cured 90 out of 200 patients.
* Drug B cured 30 out of 50 patients.

## How to calculate percentage
You can calculate what a "part" is as a percentage of a "whole" using this simple formula:

$$Percentage = \frac{Part}{Whole} \times 100$$

**Example**  
1. Let's say you took a quiz and got 18 questions right out of a total of 20 questions. What is your score as a percentage?

Part = 18  
Whole = 20  
$\frac{18}{20}=0.9$  
$0.9 \times 100 = 90\%$

2. Let's say you have 750ml of water in 1 liter botter, so what is the percentage of 750ml?

Part = 750  
Whole = 1lit = 1000

$\frac{750}{1000} \times 100 = 0.75 \times 100 = 75\%$


### Percentage to number

Converting percentage to number is in 2 steps

1. Convert the Percentage to a Decimal
The percent sign (%) means "out of one hundred." To remove the percent sign and convert the percentage to its decimal equivalent, you divide the number by 100.

$$Decimal = \frac{Percentage}{100}$$

**Example**
* 50% = $\frac{50}{100}$ = 0.50
* 12.5% = $\frac{12.5}{100}$ = 0.125
* 200% = $\frac{200}{100}$ = 2

2. Find the Percentage of a Given Number
If you need to find the actual amount (or "number") that a percentage represents of a total, you first convert the percentage to a decimal (as above) and then multiply that decimal by the total number.

$$Number\ Amount\ =\ Decimal\ Equivalent \times Total\ Number$$

**Example**
* 30% of 60 
    - 30% -> $\frac{30}{100} = 0.30$
    - $0.30 \times 60 = 18$  
* 90% of 20
    - $\frac{90}{100} = 0.90$
    - $0.90 \times 20 = 18$
* 200% of 50
    - $\frac{200}{100} = 2$
    - $2 \times 50 = 100$

### Percentage increase
To find the new total after increasing a number by a percentage:

$$New\ decimal = Original\ Number \times (1 + Decimal\ Equalent\ of\ Percent)$$

You have a salary of $40,000 and get a 5% raise. What is your new salary?
1. Convert 5% to a decimal: 5%=0.05
2. Add 1 (representing the original 100%): 1+0.05=1.05
3. Multiply: $40,000×1.05=$42,000
(Your new salary is $42,000.)

### Find Percentage increased
To find the percentage increased (or percentage change), you need to compare the amount of increase to the original number (the starting value).

$$Percentage\ Increased = \frac{New-old}{old} \times 100$$

**Example**
New salary is 42,000 old salary is $40,000, By what percent salary got increased?
- $\frac{42000-40000}{40000} = \frac{2000}{40000} = 0.05$
- 0.05 x 100 = 5  
Your new salary is increment of 5%

### Percentage decrease

To find the new total after decreasing a number by a percentage:

$$New\ decimal = Original\ Number \times (1 - Decimal\ Equalent\ of\ Percent)$$

A shirt costs $60 and is on sale for 25% off. What is the sale price?
1. Convert 25% to a decimal: 25%=0.25
2. Subtract from 1 (representing the original 100%): 1−0.25=0.75
3. Multiply: $60×0.75=$45

### Find Percentage decreased

$$Percentage\ Decreased = \frac{old-new}{old} \times 100$$

A store sold a laptop for $1,200, but later marked the price down to $960. What is the percentage decreased?
- 1200 - 960 = 240
- 240/1200 = 0.2
- 0.2 x 100 = 20%
The price decreased by 20%.

### Reverse percentage
Reverse percentage problems ask you to find the Original Value when you are given the new value and the percentage change that led to it.

$$Original\ value = \frac{New\ Value}{Percent\ Multiplier (in\ decimal)}$$
 
**Example**  
A sweater is on sale for 30% off, and the sale price is $56. What was the original price?

Percent Multiplier = 100%-30% = 70% = 0.70, So the sweater is sold for 70% of it's price 70% = 56, what is the 100% = ?

70% is 56

56/70 will give price for 1% = 0.80, then you can multiply by 100 = 0.80 * 100 = 80

$$\frac{56}{70} \times 100$$
$$\frac{56}{\frac{70}{100}}$$
$$\frac{56}{0.7} = 80$$
or

56/0.70 will give price for 100% = 80

$=\frac{56}{100\%-30\%} = \frac{56}{70\%} = \frac{56}{0.70} = 80$

## Percent vs Fractions vs Decimals
Percentages, fractions, and decimals are simply three different ways to represent the same part of a whole. They are all interconnected and can be converted from one form to another.   

### Fraction
Represents a part-to-whole relationship using division.	 

eg: $\frac{1}{4}$

### Decimal
Represents a part of a whole using place value, based on powers of 10.	
eg: 0.25

### Percent
Represents a part of a whole specifically out of 100.	
eg: 25% (25 out of 100)

## Converting

### Fraction to Percentage
Convert to a decimal first, then multiply by 100.	 
Example: 
$$\frac{1}{4} \rarr 0.25 \rarr 0.25 \times 100 = 25%$$

### Percentage to Fraction
Write the percentage as a fraction over 100, then simplify.	
Example :
$$25\%\rarr\frac{25}{100} \rarr \frac{1}{4}$$

### Fraction to Decimal	
Divide the numerator by the denominator.	 
Example:  
$$\frac{3}{5} \rarr 0.6$$

### Decimal to Fraction	
Write the digits after the decimal as the numerator, and the place value (10, 100, 1000, etc.) as the denominator. Simplify.	
Example:  
$$0.125 \rarr \frac{125}{1000} \rarr \frac{1}{8}$$

### Percent to Decimal	
Divide by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the left).	
Example:   
$$75\%\rarr\frac{75}{100} \rarr 0.75$$

### Decimal to Percent	
Multiply by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the right).	
Example:  
$$0.4 \rarr 0.40 \times 100 \rarr 40\%$$

## Addition
You can only add percentages when they refer to the same whole.

**Correct Use Case: Adding Parts of the Same Whole**

If a pie chart shows that 20% of a class likes apples and 30% of the same class likes bananas, you can add them.

$$Total\ Percentage=20\%+30\%=50\%$$
50% of the class likes either apples or bananas (assuming no overlap or double-counting).

**Incorrect Use Case: Adding Percentages of Different Wholes**
You cannot simply add a percentage of one number to a percentage of another number.

Scenario: 10% of $50 plus 20% of $100.

Wrong: 10%+20%=30%. (The answer is NOT 30% of anything meaningful.)

Correct Calculation (Adding Amounts):
1. Convert to dollar amounts: 10% of $50=0.10×50=$5
2. Convert to dollar amounts: 20% of $100=0.20×100=$20
3. Add the dollar amounts: $5+$20=$25


## Subtraction
Similar to addition, you can only subtract percentages when they refer to the same whole. Same rules applies here


If a budget is 100%, and 40% is spent on rent and 15% is spent on food, you can find the remaining percentage.

$$Remaining\ Percentage=100\%−40\%−15\%=45\%$$


## Multiplication

When you "multiply" percentages, it is called finding a percentage of a percentage. This is common in chained discounts or conditional probability.  


Rule: Always convert both percentages to decimals before multiplying.


A shirt is 20% off. A store offers an additional 10% off the sale price. What is the total discount?


Wrong: 20%+10%=30% 

**Correct Calculation:**
1. After the first discount: The remaining price is 100%−20%=80% of the original.
2. The second discount is 10% of that 80%.
3. Convert and Multiply: 0.80×0.90 (Since 100%−10%=90%)

$$ 0.80 \times 0.90=0.72 $$
Result: The final price is 72% of the original. The total effective discount is 100%−72%=28%.

## Division
Rule: Division is performed on the amounts, and then the result is converted to a percentage.

You start with $50 and end with $60. The increase is $10. What is the percent increase?

Calculation: You divide the Part (increase) by the Whole (original amount), then convert the resulting decimal to a percentage.

$$\frac{Changes\ amount}{Original\ amount} = \frac{\$10}{\$50} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%$$
