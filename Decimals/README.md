# Chapter 5: Decimals

## What is Decimal?

Decimals are another way to write fractions.It help us represent parts of whole using the **place values**.

Imagine you eat a half chocolate bar
- in Fraction: $\frac{1}{2}$ 
- in decimal: $0.5$
Both means the same. But decimals is easier for calculations


The word “decimal” comes from the Latin word “decem”, meaning ten. So decimal numbers are based on powers of 10:
- 1 tenth: $\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$
- 1 hundredth: $\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$
- 1 thousandth: $\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$

### Structure of a Decimal

A decimal has two parts:
- Whole part (left of the dot)
- Decimal part (right of the dot)

Example:

$$23.47$$

* Whole part = 23
* Decimal part = 47 (means 4tenths and 7 hundredths)

In whole numbers, the place values go left to right, starting from the ones and increasing:

```
Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones
      1000 |     100  |  10  |  1

```

But in decimal numbers, the place values go right to left after the decimal point, starting from tenths, getting smaller:

```
1     .    1     0     0
|          |     |
Ones      Tenths Hundredths

```

**Why is the order reversed after the decimal point?**

Place values are based on power of 10  
* On the left of the decimal: Each place is 10 times bigger than the one to it's right
- Ones = $10^0 = 1$
- Tens = $10^1 = 10$

* On the right of the decimal:Each place is 10 times smaller than the one to its left.
- Tenths = $10^-1 = \frac{1}{10}$
- Hundredths = $10^-2 = \frac{1}{100}$
- Thousandths = $10^-3 = \frac{1}{1000}$

So order for left is multiply by 10, right is divide by 10 

## Why use Decimals?
Decimals are easier to work with than fractions.

| Fraction         | Decimal |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| $\frac{1}{2}$    | 0.5     |
| $\frac{3}{4}$    | 0.75    |
| $\frac{7}{10}$   | 0.7     |
| $\frac{1}{1000}$ | 0.001   |

| Situation         | Fraction          | Decimal |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Money             | \$ $\frac{1}{2}$  | $ 0.50  |
| Distance (meters) | $\frac{3}{4}$ m   | 0.75 m  |
| Weight (kg)       | $\frac{7}{10}$ kg | 0.7 kg  |
| Time (hours)      | $\frac{1}{4}$ hr  | 0.25 hr |

## Place values in decimal

| Place Value      | Name            | Value as Power of 10 | Value as Fraction   |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 0.1s             | Tenths          | $10^{-1}$            | $ \frac{1}{10} $    |
| 0.01s            | Hundredths      | $10^{-2}$            | $ \frac{1}{100} $   |
| 0.001s           | Thousandths     | $10^{-3}$            | $ \frac{1}{1000} $  |
| 0.0001s          | Ten-Thousandths | $10^{-4}$            | $ \frac{1}{10000} $ |

$42.685 == 40 + 2 + \frac{10}{6} + \frac{100}{8} + \frac{1000}{5} $


## Comparing and Ordering Decimals
Comparing and ordering decimals involves determining which decimal is larger or smaller than others. This process is very similar to comparing whole numbers, but you must pay close attention to the digits' place values

1. 4.67>4.62
2. 4.6 < 4.67
3. 0.5=0.50=0.500
4. 3.400 > 3.385

### Order the following decimals from Least to Greatest:

1.5,0.95,1.05,1.503 this can be written as 1.500,0.950,1.050,1.503

`0.95,1.05,1.5,1.503`

1.500 vs 1.503
Tenths are equal (5=5).
Hundredths are equal (0=0).
Thousandths: 0 vs 3. 1.500 is smaller than 1.503.


## Addition

### Example

1. Integer with Decimal
15 + 3.82

```
15.00
+3.82
-----
18.82
```

2. Decimal with Decimal
4.6 + 12.075
```
       4.600
     +12.075
     --------
      16.675
```

## Subtraction

### Example

1. Integer with Decimal
25 − 9.14
```
25.00
-9.14
------
15.86

```

2. Decimal with Decimal
10.51 − 4.6
```
10.51
-4.60
------
 5.91   
```

## Multiplication
1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers (ignore the decimal points initially).
2. Count the total number of decimal places in the original factors.
3. Place the decimal point in the final product by counting that total number of places from the right end of the product.

### Example

1. Integer with Decimal
24×0.5
* Multiply 24×5=120.
* Count decimal places: 24 (0 places) and 0.5 (1 place). Total: 0+1=1 place.
* Start from the right of 120 and move the decimal point 1 place to the left: 12.0  
`24×0.5=12`  

2.  Decimal with Decimal
1.3×0.02
* Multiply 13×2=26  
* Count decimal places: 1.3 (1 place) and 0.02 (2 places). Total: 1+2=3 places.  
* Start from the right of 26 and move the decimal point 3 places to the left, adding a leading zero: 0.026.  
`1.3×0.02=0.026`

## Division
1. If the divisor (the number you are dividing by) is a decimal, move its decimal point to the far right to make it a whole number.
2. Move the decimal point in the dividend (the number being divided) the same number of places to the right. Add trailing zeros to the dividend if needed.
3. Place the decimal point in the quotient (the answer) directly above the new position of the decimal point in the dividend.
4. Perform the division as usual.


### Example

1. Integer by Decimal
10÷0.5
* Divisor is 0.5. Move the decimal 1 place right to get 5.
* Dividend is 10. Move its decimal 1 place right to get 10.0->100.
* Divide 100÷5=20.
`10÷0.5=20`

2. Decimal by Integer
0.5÷2
When you divide a number by 10, 100, 1000, and so on, you simply move the decimal point to the left by the number of zeros in the divisor.

```
       0.   2     5
      ______________
     2|0.   5     0
       -    4
      --------------
            1     0
      -     1     0
      ---------------
            0     0

```

3.  Decimal by Decimal
4.8÷0.06
* Divisor is 0.06. Move the decimal 2 places right to get 6.
* Dividend is 4.8. Move its decimal 2 places right, adding a zero: 4.80->480.
* Divide 480÷6. Place the decimal point after the 0 in 480 (i.e., 480.) and divide.
`480÷6=80`

`4.8÷0.06=80`

### Quick way

1. $$\mathbf{\frac{0.6}{0.003}}$$

If we divide it will give `200` 

Some times it will be hard to work with decimal in that case convert the decimal to integer and do the division

`0.6` has `1` decimal and `0.003` has `3` decimals after `.` so the larger one is 3, multiply both with `1000`

$$\frac{0.6 \times 1000}{0.003 \times 1000} = \frac{600}{3} = 200$$

In both way the result is 200


2. $$\mathbf{\frac{0.4}{5}}$$

Direct multiply
$$\frac{0.4}{5} = 0.08$$

Convert to int
`0.4` has one decimal so mmultiply with 10 
$$\frac{0.4 \times 10}{5 \times 10} = \frac{4}{50} = \frac{2}{25} = 0.08$$

>[!NOTE]  
> In the convert to int we have to multiply both the terms, then only it will give the correct result

## Conversion

### Decimal to fraction
The process of converting a decimal to a fraction is based on the concept of place value. Since decimals are simply fractions with a denominator that is a power of 10 (like 10,100,1000, etc.), the conversion method leverages this structure.

1. Determine the Denominator (The Power of 10)
Count the number of digits that are to the right of the decimal point. This number tells you the power of 10 to use for the denominator

2.  Determine the Numerator
Write the digits that are to the right of the decimal point as the numerator. Ignore any leading zeros (zeros immediately after the decimal point, like in 0.05).

3. Simplify the Fraction
Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) until the fraction is in its simplest form.

| Decimal | Step 1: Count Digits | Step 2: Write as Fraction | Step 3: Simplify   |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 0.6     | 1 digit              | $\frac{6}{10}$        | $\frac{6 \div 2}{10 \div 2} = \frac{3}{5}$ |
| 0.35    | 2 digits             | $\frac{35}{100}$      | $\frac{35 \div 5}{ 100 \div 5} = \frac{7}{20}$ |
| 0.004   | 3 digits             | $\frac{4}{1000}$      | $\frac{4 \div 4}{1000 \div 4} = \frac{1}{250}$ |

### Converting Decimals with Whole Numbers
If the decimal has a whole number part (e.g., 12.45), you have two options:
1. Mixed Number: Keep the whole number separate and convert only the decimal part.
2. Improper Fraction: Convert the entire number into a fraction.

#### Example: Convert 3.75
**Option 1 (Mixed Number):**
1. The whole number is 3.
2. Convert 0.75
      .75 has 2 digit so 100
      75/100 GCD is 25
      $\frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4}$
3. Result: $3\frac{3}{4}$ 

**Option 2 (Improper Fraction):**
1. The last digit (5) is in the hundredths place, so the denominator is 100.
2. Write the entire number (375) as the numerator.
3. $\frac{375}{100}$   
GCD is 25  
4. $\frac{375 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{15}{4}$

### Converting Repeating Decimals

1. 0.333333..
* Step 1: Rule
If there is 1 repeating digit, the denominator of the fraction will be 9.
* Step 2: Write as a Fraction
Since the repeating digit is 3, we write it as:
* Step 3: Simplify
Simplifying $\frac{3}{9}$  by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
$\frac{3 \div 3}{9 \div 3} = \frac{1}{3}$

2. 0.45454545....
* Step 1: Rule
If there are 2 repeating digits, the denominator of the fraction will be 99.
* Step 2: Write as a Fraction
Since the repeating part is 45, we write it as: $\frac{45}{99}$ 
* Step 3: Simplify
Simplifying $\frac{3}{9}$, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 9:
$\frac{45 \div 9}{99 \div 9} = \frac{5}{11}$

```
1 repeating digit: The denominator is 9.
2 repeating digits: The denominator is 99.
3 repeating digits: The denominator is 999.
And so on—if there are n repeating digits, the denominator will be a number with n nines.
```

## Repeating and Terminating Decimals
When you convert a fraction into a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator, the result will always be one of two types of decimals: terminating or repeating.


### Terminating Decimals

A terminating decimal is a decimal that ends or stops. It has a finite number of digits after the decimal point.

A fraction will result in a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors of its simplified denominator are only 2s and/or 5s.
Since the decimal system is based on 10, and the prime factors of 10 are 2×5, any denominator that can be completely multiplied up to a power of 10 will terminate.


| Fraction  | Prime Factors of Denominator | Division | Decimal |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------|---------|
| $ \frac{2}{1} $  | 2                            | $ 1 \div 2 $  | 0.5     |
| $ \frac{4}{3} $  | $ 2 \times 2 $             | $ 3 \div 4 $  | 0.75    |
| $ \frac{10}{7} $ | $ 2 \times 5 $             | $ 7 \div 10 $ | 0.7     |
| $ \frac{25}{13} $ | $ 5 \times 5 $            | $ 13 \div 25 $ | 0.52    |
| $ \frac{80}{9} $ | $ 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 5 $ | $ 9 \div 80 $ | 0.1125  |

### Repeating (Non-Terminating) Decimals
A repeating decimal (also called a non-terminating decimal) is a decimal that goes on forever, and the digits eventually fall into a repeating pattern.

A fraction will result in a repeating decimal if the prime factors of its simplified denominator contain any number other than 2 or 5 (such as 3,7,11, etc.).

| Fraction     | Prime Factors of Denominator | Division    | Decimal           | Notation      |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| $\frac{3}{1}$  | 3                            | $1 \div 3$  | 0.3333…           | 0.$\overline{3}$ |
| $\frac{11}{2}$ | 11                           | $2 \div 11$ | 0.181818…         | 0.$\overline{18}$ |
| $\frac{6}{5}$  | $2 \times 3$             | $5 \div 6$  | 0.8333…           | $0.8\overline{3}$ |
| $\frac{7}{1}$  | 7                            | $1 \div 7$  | 0.142857142857…   | 0.$\overline{142857}$ |


## Shortcuts

### GCD (Greatest common Divisior)

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), is the largest whole number that divides exactly into two or more numbers.

The Need for GCD: Simplifying Fractions
Imagine you have a large fraction, like  $\frac{12}{18}$


**Meaning**
Let’s say you baked a rectangular pizza and cut it into 18 equal small squares. You then gave away 12 of those squares. $\frac{12}{18}$

Now, look at the pizza. Can you rearrange those 12 pieces and the 18 total pieces so that the fraction looks simpler, but still represents the exact same amount of pizza?

* If you group the small pieces into pairs, you now have 18÷2=9 larger pieces in total, and you gave away 12÷2=6 of them. The fraction is   $\frac{6}{6}$. This is simpler, but can we go further?
* If you group the small pieces into threes, you now have 18÷3=6 larger pieces in total, and you gave away 12÷3=4 of them. The fraction is  $\frac{4}{6}$. This is simpler, but can we go further?

* If you group the small pieces into four, you now have 18÷4=4.5 larger pieces in total, we got decimal not possible

* If you group the small pieces into four, you now have 18÷5=3.6 larger pieces in total, we got decimal not possible

* 18/6 = 3, 12/6 = 2

We reached the half of one number 12/6, stop here because we can't divide 12 further

We are looking for the biggest possible group size that we can divide both the numerator (12) and the denominator (18) by, which will give us the simplest equivalent fraction.

We need a number that can divide both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder. We're looking for the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

So the GCD is 6
