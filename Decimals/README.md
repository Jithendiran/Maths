# Chapter 5: Decimals

## What is Decimal?

Decimals are another way to write fractions.It help us represent parts of whole using the **place values**.

Imagine you eat a half chocolate bar
- in Fraction: $\frac{1}{2}$ 
- in decimal: $0.5$
Both means the same. But decimals is easier for calculations


The word “decimal” comes from the Latin word “decem”, meaning ten. So decimal numbers are based on powers of 10:
- 1 tenth: $\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$
- 1 hundredth: $\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$
- 1 thousandth: $\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$

### Structure of a Decimal

A decimal has two parts:
- Whole part (left of the dot)
- Decimal part (right of the dot)

Example:

$$23.47$$

* Whole part = 23
* Decimal part = 47 (means 4tenths and 7 hundredths)

In whole numbers, the place values go left to right, starting from the ones and increasing:

```
Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones
      1000 |     100  |  10  |  1

```

But in decimal numbers, the place values go right to left after the decimal point, starting from tenths, getting smaller:

```
1     .    1     0     0
      ↓     ↓     ↓
    Ones  Tenths Hundredths

```

**Why is the order reversed after the decimal point?**

Place values are based on power of 10  
* On the left of the decimal: Each place is 10 times bigger than the one to it's right
- Ones = $10^0 = 1$
- Tens = $10^1 = 10$

* On the right of the decimal:Each place is 10 times smaller than the one to its left.
- Tenths = $10^-1 = \frac{1}{10}$
- Hundredths = $10^-2 = \frac{1}{100}$
- Thousandths = $10^-3 = \frac{1}{1000}$

So order for left is multiply by 10, right is divide by 10 

## Why use Decimals?
Decimals are easier to work with than fractions.

| Fraction         | Decimal |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| $\frac{1}{2}$    | 0.5     |
| $\frac{3}{4}$    | 0.75    |
| $\frac{7}{10}$   | 0.7     |
| $\frac{1}{1000}$ | 0.001   |

| Situation         | Fraction          | Decimal |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Money             | ₹ $\frac{1}{2}$   | ₹ 0.50  |
| Distance (meters) | $\frac{3}{4}$ m   | 0.75 m  |
| Weight (kg)       | $\frac{7}{10}$ kg | 0.7 kg  |
| Time (hours)      | $\frac{1}{4}$ hr  | 0.25 hr |

### compare
Decimals are easier to compare

$$\frac{3}{8} vs \frac{4}{9}$$
To compre you need to do LCM or cross multiplications

With decimals
$$0.375\ vs\ 0.444$$
