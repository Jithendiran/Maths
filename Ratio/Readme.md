# Chapter 7: Ratio

## What is Ratio
A ratio is a comparison of two quantities of the same kind and in the same units. It tells you how much of one thing there is compared to another.

Notation: A ratio can be written in a few ways:
* Using a colon: `a:b`
* As a fraction: $\frac{a}{b}$
* Using words: `a to b`

Example: If you have 4 apples and 6 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 4:6. To simplify it, divide both sides by 2:

$$Fraction\ :\ \frac{ 4 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$Ratio\ :\ 2:3$$

It's a statement of relationship. If the ratio of sugar to flour is 1:3, it means the amount of flour is always three times the amount of sugar, no matter if you're making a small cookie or a giant cake.

# Proportions

## What is proportions
A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal.

*Notation*: If the ratio a:b is equal to the ratio c:d, we write it as:

$$a:b :: c : d$$
or
$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$

*The Cross-Multiplication Rule*: This is the most important rule for solving proportion problems. If  $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$
$$a \times d=b \times c$$
 A proportion is used to find a missing value in an equivalent ratio

**Example**:

If 2 pens cost $4, how much do 5 pens cost?  

**Normal method**

Find the cost of single pen: 

$\frac{4}{2} = 2$, 2$ is the price of each pen  

Now the new quantity or count is 5, we know the price which is \$2, no matter how much pen we have, price is always \$2 for each pen

so $5 \times 2 = 10$ \$ is the price for 5 pens

**In cross multiply method**

Let x be the cost of 5 pens. The ratio of (pens : cost) must be the same:

$$\frac{2}{4} = \frac{5}{x}$$

Now, use the cross-multiplication rule:

$$2 \times x = 4 \times 5$$
$$ 2 \times x = 20 $$
$$ x = \frac{20}{2} $$
$$ x = 10 $$

How it give the same result?
Lets for say 2 is the `old quantity` and 4\$ is the `old price`, 5 is the `new quanity` the `new price` is unknown

$$\text{New price}=\frac{\text{Old quantity}}{\text{Old price}} \times \text{New Quantity}$$
$$ = \frac{4}{2} \times 5 = 2 \times 5 = 10$$

This is same as

$$\text{New price}=\frac{\text{Old quantity} \times \text{New Quantity}}{\text{Old price}} $$
$$ = \frac{4 \times 5}{2}  = \frac{20}{2} = 10$$

How both gave the same result?
$$\text{New price}=\frac{\text{Old quantity}}{\text{Old price}} \times \text{New Quantity}$$
In the $\frac{\text{Old quantity}}{\text{Old price}}$ method we find single unit price and do scale up for desire count

$$\text{New price}=\frac{\text{Old quantity} \times \text{New Quantity}}{\text{Old price}} $$
In cross multiplication, we are doing $\text{Old quantity} \times \text{New Quantity}$ and dividing (eliminating) old price, so we left with new price

This is `Associative Property`, no matter how we group and multiply while diving we get the same result

Let's see new combination 

$$\text{New price}= \text{Old quantity} \times \frac{\text{New Quantity}}{\text{Old price}}$$
$$ = 4 \times \frac{5}{2} = 4 \times 2.5 = 10$$

`Associative Property` is proved no matter which grouping we do 1st

1. $$(4 \times 5) \div 2 = 20 \div 2 = 10$$
  This like eliminating old price   

This method is about calculating a temporary, grossly oversized price ($20) and then scaling it down proportionally to account for the fact that the original $4 was for two items, not one. It's the most direct algebraic path from the cross-multiplication setup.

---

2. $$(4 \div 2) \times 5 = 2 \times 5 = 10$$
This is like finding unit price

This method logically breaks the proportion into two understandable steps: first finding the cost of one unit, and then multiplying that consistent rate by the new number of units. This is often the easiest method to explain to someone.

---

3. $$(5 \div 2) \times 4 = 2.5 \times 4 = 10$$

* The new quantity (5 pens) is how many times larger than the old quantity (2 pens)?  
* The answer is 2.5. New price 2.5 times the number of pens.
* Since the price must scale proportionally, you multiply the old price ($4) by the scaling factor (2.5).

Find the Scaling Factor first, then multiply by old price.

---

So, 5 pens cost $10. so the ratio is `2:4::5:10`
### Ways to find the value

#### **1. Scaling Up or Scaling Down**

In proportions, scaling is all about adjusting one part of the ratio while maintaining the same relationship between the other parts. You can either scale up (when the new quantity is larger) or scale down (when the new quantity is smaller) to find the missing value.

##### **Scaling Up**:

This involves determining how much larger the new quantity is compared to the old quantity and applying the same scaling factor to the old price (or the other ratio component).

**Formula**:
$$ \text{New value} = \text{Old value} \times \frac{\text{New Quantity}}{\text{Old Quantity}} $$

**Example**: If 2 apples cost $4, how much do 8 apples cost?

Here, the old quantity is 2 apples and the old price is $4. The new quantity is 8 apples, and we need to find the new price.

We can scale up as follows:
$$ \text{New Price} = 4 \times \frac{8}{2} = 4 \times 4 = 16 $$

$\frac{8}{2} = 4$ tells that the new value is 4 times bigger, so price also 4 times bigger 

So, 8 apples cost $16.

---

##### **Scaling Down**:

This method is used when the new quantity is smaller than the old one. You use the same scaling factor, but this time you’re scaling down to find the missing value.

**Formula**:
$$ \text{New value} = \text{Old value} \times \frac{\text{New Quantity}}{\text{Old Quantity}} $$

**Example**: If 8 apples cost $16, how much do 2 apples cost?

Here, the old quantity is 8 apples and the old price is $16. The new quantity is 2 apples, and we need to find the new price.

We can scale down:
$$ \text{New Price} = 16 \times \frac{2}{8} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4 $$

So, 2 apples cost $4.

---

#### **2. Finding the Missing Value Using Unit Rate**

The unit rate method is a more straightforward approach that focuses on finding the cost per unit (or price per unit) and then multiplying it by the new quantity. This can be particularly useful when you’re looking for the price per one unit and then scaling it.

**Formula**:

$$ \text{Unit Rate} = \frac{\text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Quantity}} $$

Then, multiply the unit rate by the new quantity:
$$ \text{New Price} = \text{Unit Rate} \times \text{New Quantity} $$

---

**Example**: If 4 pens cost $8, how much do 6 pens cost?

1. **Step 1**: Find the unit rate (cost per pen):
   $$ \text{Unit Rate} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 $$
   So, each pen costs $2.

2. **Step 2**: Multiply the unit rate by the new quantity (6 pens):
   $$ \text{New Price} = 2 \times 6 = 12 $$

So, 6 pens cost $12.

---

#### **3. The Cross-Multiplication Method (Traditional)**

This is the algebraic method, which is what you initially mentioned. It uses the standard proportion equation and cross-multiplication to solve for the missing value.

**Formula**:
$$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} $$
Then, using cross-multiplication:
$$ a \times d = b \times c $$

This method works well when we need an exact solution without first calculating a unit rate or scaling factor.

---

#### **Comparing the Three Methods:**

* **Scaling Up / Scaling Down**: Good for simple problems where you can directly see the relationship between the quantities and prices.
* **Unit Rate**: Very clear when you need to find the price (or another value) per unit and then scale it up or down. Often the easiest for people to understand.
* **Cross-Multiplication**: Algebraic and precise, especially for more complicated proportions or when more than one unknown is involved.

---

#### **More Examples to Illustrate the Methods**

---

##### **1. Scaling Up** (Direct Proportion):

**Problem**: If 3 oranges cost $6, how much do 9 oranges cost?

* **Scaling Up**:
  $$ \text{New Price} = 6 \times \frac{9}{3} = 6 \times 3 = 18 $$
  So, 9 oranges cost $18.

---

##### **2. Scaling Down** (Inverse Proportion):

**Problem**: If 12 pounds of flour cost $24, how much do 4 pounds cost?

* **Scaling Down**:
  $$ \text{New Price} = 24 \times \frac{4}{12} = 24 \times \frac{1}{3} = 8 $$
  So, 4 pounds of flour cost $8.

---

##### **3. Using Unit Rate** (Cost per unit):

**Problem**: If 10 kilograms of rice cost $30, how much do 4 kilograms cost?

* **Unit Rate**:
  $$ \text{Unit Rate} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \text{ dollars per kilogram} $$
  $$ \text{New Price} = 3 \times 4 = 12 $$
  So, 4 kilograms of rice cost $12.

---

### Finding missing value

For simplicity showed in algebric method

$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$
$$a \times d = b \times c$$

#### a is missed

$$ a = \frac{b \times c}{d} $$


#### b is missed

$$ b = \frac{a \times d}{c} $$

#### c is missed

$$ c = \frac{a \times d}{b} $$

#### d is missed

$$ d = \frac{b \times c}{a} $$


## Where it use?

It allows you to scale a recipe, a map, or a financial breakdown. If the relationship is 1:3 for a small batch, it must be the same (2:6, 10:30, etc.) for a larger batch

## Addition

Ratios can’t be added or subtracted directly unless they have the same 'whole' reference or are converted to the same denominator (like fractions).

We add the parts of a ratio to find the Total Number of Parts, which allows us to divide a total quantity.

**Example**

In a school, the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4. If there are 56 students in total, how many boys are there in the class?

1. Add the parts of the ratio:

$$Group =3 (boys)+4 (girls)=7\ students$$

So one group will have 7 students

2. Divide the total quantity by the per group student count.

The total quantity of the students is 56, 

$$= \frac{\text{56 students}}{\text{7 stuents per group}} =  \text{8 Group of stduents}$$

3. Calculate the boys count

$$Boys = 3 \times 8 = 24$$

For 8 groups 24 boys

## Subtraction

We subtract the parts of a ratio to find the difference in the number of parts, which helps us solve problems where the difference between two quantities is known.

**Example**

The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:3. If there are 5 more boys than girls, how many girls are there?

1. Find the difference
$$4 - 3 = 1 \text{ each group has 1 boy extra}$$

2. question is about 5 more boys, now find how many groups present
$$\frac{5\text{ more of boys}}{1\text{ each group has extra boy}} = \frac{5}{1} = 5\ groups$$

3. Now we found if 5 groups of students are present, 5 more boys will be there, so the girls count for 5 group is

$$3 \times 5 = 15\text{ girls}$$

---
The number of red balls and blue balls in a box is in the ratio 7:4. If there are 18 more red balls than blue balls, how many balls are there in total?

1. $$7-4=3 \text{ each group has 3 more red balls}$$
2. $$\text{we have 18 more of red balls} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ groups}$$
3. $$7 \times 6\text{ = 42 red balls}, 4 \times 6\text{ = 24 blue balls} = 42 + 24 = \text{66 balls in total}$$

## more
If the ratio of A to B is 2:3, and the ratio of B to C is 6:5, find the combined ratio A:B:C.?

1. Identify the Common Element: The common element is B.
$$\text{A : B = 2 : 3}$$

$$\text{B : C = 6 : 5}$$

2. Make the Common Element Equal: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two values for B (which are 3 and 6). The LCM of 3 and 6 is 6.

3. Adjust the First Ratio (A:B): To change the '3' in the ratio 2:3 to '6', multiply both sides by 2.

$$\text{A : B = (2 * 2) : (3 * 2) = 4 : 6}$$

4. Adjust the second Ratio (B:C): B is already in common multiple value so no need to change 

5. Combine the Ratios: Now that the value for B is the same in both, you can write the combined ratio.

$$\text{A:B:C=4:6:5}$$

### Key Types of Proportions

### Direct proportion (Division)
Direct Proportion (or Direct Variation): As one quantity increases, the other quantity increases at the same rate. (e.g., More hours worked = more money earned).

$$\frac{x}{y} = k \quad \text{or} \quad x = ky$$

Where **k** is a constant.

**division** (comparing values as a ratio) is used because we are looking at how much one value is **per unit of the other**.

* We're comparing how many **units of one** we get **per unit of the other**.
* For example: If 2 pencils cost $4, then the cost per pencil is:
  $$
  \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pencil}
  $$
* This constant rate ($2 per pencil) means **direct proportion**.

#### Example

* If 1 apple costs $2, then 5 apples cost $10.
* As the number of apples increases, the total cost increases **directly**.
* $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10}  \rarr constant\ ratio.$

### In-direct propertion (Multiplication)
Inverse Proportion (or Inverse Variation): As one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases. (e.g., More workers on a job = less time to complete it).

$$x \times y = k$$

Where **k** is a constant.

* If **x** doubles, **y** must be halved to keep ($ x \times y $) the same.
* The two values "balance each other out" through multiplication.
* You're trying to **keep the total (product)** the same.

#### Example
4 workers take 6 hours -> 4 × 6 = 24 (24 is constant)

* If you have **8 workers**, to keep the total work the same:
$$
8 \times y = 24 \Rightarrow y = \frac{24}{8} = 3
$$
* More workers -> less time, but **product stays constant**.


## Questions

1. A recipe calls for a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar. You want to make a batch that uses 12 cups of flour. How many cups of sugar will you need to maintain the same ratio?

### **Given**:

* The **ratio of flour to sugar** is **2:3** (2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar).
* You have **12 cups of flour**, and you need to figure out how many cups of sugar are required to maintain the same ratio.

---

### **Steps to Solve**:

#### Step 1: Set up the proportion

You want to keep the same ratio of flour to sugar, so you set it up as a proportion:

$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{12}{x}
$$

Here, ( x ) represents the number of cups of sugar you need to find.

#### Step 2: Cross-multiply

To solve for ( x ), cross-multiply:

$$
2 \times x = 3 \times 12
$$

$$
2x = 36
$$

#### Step 3: Solve for ( x )

Now, divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{36}{2} = 18
$$

#### **Final Answer**:

You will need **18 cups of sugar** to maintain the same ratio when using 12 cups of flour.



### **1. The ratio of apples to oranges in a basket is 5:3. If there are 35 apples, how many oranges are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 5:3 (apples to oranges)
* **Apples**: 35

We know that the number of apples and oranges are proportional, so let's set up a proportion:

$$
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{35}{x}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
5 \times x = 3 \times 35
$$
$$
5x = 105
$$
$$
x = \frac{105}{5} = 21
$$

So, the number of oranges is **21**. 

---

### **2. The ratio of red balls to blue balls in a box is 7:8. If there are 45 total balls in the box, how many red balls are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 7:8 (red balls to blue balls)
* **Total balls**: 45

Total parts = $7 + 8 = 15$ parts.
Each part represents $\frac{45}{15} = 3$ balls.

Now, the number of red balls:

$$
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ red balls}
$$

So, there are **21 red balls**. 

---

### **3. A car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons of gas. How far will it travel on 18 gallons of gas?**

This is an example of **direct proportion** because more gallons of gas should result in more miles traveled. We set up the proportion:

$$
\frac{180}{12} = \frac{x}{18}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
180 \times 18 = 12 \times x
$$
$$
3240 = 12x
$$
$$
x = \frac{3240}{12} = 270 \text{ miles}
$$

So, the car will travel **270 miles**. 

---

### **4. A chemist mixes two solutions in the ratio 4:5. If she has 48 liters of the first solution, how many liters of the second solution will she need to maintain the ratio?**

* **Given ratio**: 4:5 (first solution to second solution)
* **First solution**: 48 liters

Set up a proportion:

$$
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{48}{x}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
4x = 5 \times 48
$$
$$
4x = 240
$$
$$
x = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ liters}
$$

So, the chemist needs **60 liters** of the second solution. 

---

### **5. A company distributes profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 among three partners A, B, and C. If the total profit is $18,000, how much does each partner get?**

* **Given ratio**: 3:2:1 (A:B:C)
* **Total profit**: $18,000

First, find the total number of parts:

$$
3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \text{ parts}
$$

Each part is worth:

$$
\frac{18,000}{6} = 3,000
$$

Now, calculate each partner's share:

* A’s share: $3 \times 3,000 = 9,000$
* B’s share: $2 \times 3,000 = 6,000$
* C’s share: $1 \times 3,000 = 3,000$

So, each partner gets:

* **A**: $9,000
* **B**: $6,000
* **C**: $3,000

 Great use of the ratio and proportion here.

### **6. A group of students is divided into two categories, juniors and seniors, in the ratio 3:4. If 210 students are juniors, how many total students are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 3:4 (juniors to seniors)
* **Juniors**: 210

Let’s calculate the number of parts for juniors and seniors:

The ratio of juniors to seniors is 3:4, so the total parts are:

$$
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ parts}
$$

Each part represents:

$$
\frac{210}{3} = 70 \text{ students per part}
$$

Now calculate the number of seniors:

$$
4 \times 70 = 280 \text{ seniors}
$$

The total number of students is:

$$
210 + 280 = 490 \text{ students}
$$

 There are **490 students** in total.

---
### **7. A car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons of gas. What is the car's fuel efficiency (its unit rate)?**

$$\text{Unit Rate} = \frac{Distance}{Gallons}=\frac{180 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ gallons}} = 15 \text{ miles per gallons}$$

$$y = kx$$
$$Distance=15×Gallons$$
This 15 is the constant of proportionality, k.

---
### **8.Find the ratio of 50 centimeters to 2 meters.**
1. Identify the Units: We have centimeters (cm) and meters (m). They are different.

2. Convert to the Same Unit: Convert the larger unit (m) to the smaller unit (cm):

$$1\text{ meter} = 100 \text{ centimeter}$$
$$2\text{ meter} = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ centimeter}$$

3. Ratio: 
$$50:200$$

4. Simplify:
$$1:4$$

### **9. If the ratio of boys to girls is 4:5, what percentage of the total students are boys?**
1. Find total
$$\text{students} = \text{boys + girls} = 4 + 5 = 9$$
2. Percentage of boys
$$=\frac{part}{whole}\times100 $$
$$=\frac{4}{9}\times 100$$
$$=0.4444\times100= 44.44\%$$

### **10. A product is on sale for 20% off. What is the ratio of the discount to the original price?**

1. Percent to fraction 
$$20\%=\frac{20}{100}$$

2. simplify
$$ = 20:100 $$
$$ = 1:5$$

### **11. A diver descends from a platform $10 \text{ meters}$ above the water (at $t=0$ seconds) to a depth of $5 \text{ meters}$ below the water (at $t=5$ seconds). What is the average rate of change in his position?**

* Starting Position: 10 meters above the water. water level is marked as 0 meter, as height goes up it is +ve
* Ending Position: 5 meters below the water. The height goes down which is inside water so it is -5


1.  Identify Points:
    * Initial Point ($x_1, y_1$): $(0 \text{ seconds}, +10 \text{ meters})$
    * Final Point ($x_2, y_2$): $(5 \text{ seconds}, -5 \text{ meters})$ (Depth is usually negative)

2.  Calculate the Rate of Change:
    $$\text{Rate of Change} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{(-5) - 10}{5 - 0}$$   $$\text{Rate of Change} = \frac{-15}{5} = -3 \text{ meters/second}$$

The negative rate of change ($-3 \text{ m/s}$) shows the diver is moving downward, decreasing his vertical position by 3 meters every second.

### **12.  What percent of 80 is 16?**
$$\frac{16}{80}=\frac{x}{100}$$
$$x * 80 = 16 * 100$$
$$x = \frac{1600}{80}$$
$$x = 20$$
