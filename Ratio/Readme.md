# Chapter 7: Ratio

## What is Ratio
A ratio is a comparison of two quantities of the same kind and in the same units. It tells you how much of one thing there is compared to another.

Notation: A ratio can be written in a few ways:
* Using a colon: `a:b`
* As a fraction: $\frac{a}{b}$
* Using words: `a to b`

Example: If you have 4 apples and 6 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 4:6. To simplify it, divide both sides by 2:

$$Fraction\ :\ \frac{ 4 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$Ratio\ :\ 2:3$$

It's a statement of relationship. If the ratio of sugar to flour is 1:3, it means the amount of flour is always three times the amount of sugar, no matter if you're making a small cookie or a giant cake.

# Proportions

## What is proportions
A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal.

*Notation*: If the ratio a:b is equal to the ratio c:d, we write it as:

$$a:b :: c : d$$
or
$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$

*The Cross-Multiplication Rule*: This is the most important rule for solving proportion problems. If  $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$
$$a \times d=b \times c$$
 A proportion is used to find a missing value in an equivalent ratio, usually written as an equation:  

Example: If 2 pens cost $4, how much do 5 pens cost?  
Let x be the cost of 5 pens. The ratio of (pens : cost) must be the same:

$$\frac{2}{4} = \frac{5}{x}$$

Now, use the cross-multiplication rule:

$$2 \times x = 4 \times 5$$
$$ 2 \times x = 20 $$
$$ x = \frac{20}{2} $$
$$ x = 10 $$

So, 5 pens cost $10. so the ratio is `2:5::4:10`

It allows you to scale a recipe, a map, or a financial breakdown. If the relationship is 1:3 for a small batch, it must be the same (2:6, 10:30, etc.) for a larger batch

## Addition

Ratios can’t be added or subtracted directly unless they have the same 'whole' reference or are converted to the same denominator (like fractions).

We add the parts of a ratio to find the Total Number of Parts, which allows us to divide a total quantity.

**Example**

In a school, the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4. If there are 56 students in total, how many boys are there in the class?

1. Add the parts of the ratio:

$$Group =3 (boys)+4 (girls)=7\ students$$

So one group will have 7 students

2. Divide the total quantity by the per group student count.

The total quantity of the students is 56, 

$$= \frac{\text{56 students}}{\text{7 stuents per group}} =  \text{8 Group of stduents}$$

3. Calculate the boys count

$$Boys = 3 \times 8 = 24$$

For 8 groups 24 boys

## Subtraction

We subtract the parts of a ratio to find the difference in the number of parts, which helps us solve problems where the difference between two quantities is known.

**Example**

The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:3. If there are 5 more boys than girls, how many girls are there?

1. Find the difference
$$4 - 3 = 1 \text{each group has 1 boy extra}$$

2. question is about 5 more boys, now find how many groups present
$$\frac{5\text{more of boys}}{1\text{each group has extra boy}} = \frac{5}{1} = 5\ groups$$

3. Now we found if 5 groups of students are present, 5 more boys will be there, so the girls count for 5 group is

$$3 \times 5 = 15\text{ girls}$$

---
The number of red balls and blue balls in a box is in the ratio 7:4. If there are 18 more red balls than blue balls, how many balls are there in total?

1. $$7-4=3 \text{ each group has 3 more red balls}$$
2. $$\text{we have 18 more of red balls} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ groups}$$
3. $$7 \times 6\text{ = 42 red balls}, 4 \times 6\text{ = 24 blue balls} = 42 + 24 = \text{66 balls in total}$$

## more
If the ratio of A to B is 2:3, and the ratio of B to C is 6:5, find the combined ratio A:B:C.?

1. Identify the Common Element: The common element is B.
$$\text{A : B = 2 : 3}$$

$$\text{B : C = 6 : 5}$$

2. Make the Common Element Equal: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two values for B (which are 3 and 6). The LCM of 3 and 6 is 6.

3. Adjust the First Ratio (A:B): To change the '3' in the ratio 2:3 to '6', multiply both sides by 2.

$$\text{A : B = (2 * 2) : (3 * 2) = 4 : 6}$$

4. Combine the Ratios: Now that the value for B is the same in both, you can write the combined ratio.

$$\text{A:B:C=4:6:5}$$

### Key Types of Proportions

### Direct proportion (Division)
Direct Proportion (or Direct Variation): As one quantity increases, the other quantity increases at the same rate. (e.g., More hours worked = more money earned).

$$\frac{x}{y} = k \quad \text{or} \quad x = ky$$

Where **k** is a constant.

**division** (comparing values as a ratio) is used because we are looking at how much one value is **per unit of the other**.

* We're comparing how many **units of one** we get **per unit of the other**.
* For example: If 2 pencils cost $4, then the cost per pencil is:
  $$
  \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pencil}
  $$
* This constant rate ($2 per pencil) means **direct proportion**.

#### Example

* If 1 apple costs $2, then 5 apples cost $10.
* As the number of apples increases, the total cost increases **directly**.
* $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10}  \rarr constant\ ratio.$

### In-direct propertion (Multiplication)
Inverse Proportion (or Inverse Variation): As one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases. (e.g., More workers on a job = less time to complete it).

$$x \times y = k$$

Where **k** is a constant.

* If **x** doubles, **y** must be halved to keep ($ x \times y $) the same.
* The two values "balance each other out" through multiplication.
* You're trying to **keep the total (product)** the same.

#### Example
4 workers take 6 hours -> 4 × 6 = 24 (24 is constant)

* If you have **8 workers**, to keep the total work the same:
$$
8 \times y = 24 \Rightarrow y = \frac{24}{8} = 3
$$
* More workers -> less time, but **product stays constant**.


## Questions

1. A recipe calls for a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar. You want to make a batch that uses 12 cups of flour. How many cups of sugar will you need to maintain the same ratio?

### **Given**:

* The **ratio of flour to sugar** is **2:3** (2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar).
* You have **12 cups of flour**, and you need to figure out how many cups of sugar are required to maintain the same ratio.

---

### **Steps to Solve**:

#### Step 1: Set up the proportion

You want to keep the same ratio of flour to sugar, so you set it up as a proportion:

$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{12}{x}
$$

Here, ( x ) represents the number of cups of sugar you need to find.

#### Step 2: Cross-multiply

To solve for ( x ), cross-multiply:

$$
2 \times x = 3 \times 12
$$

$$
2x = 36
$$

#### Step 3: Solve for ( x )

Now, divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{36}{2} = 18
$$

#### **Final Answer**:

You will need **18 cups of sugar** to maintain the same ratio when using 12 cups of flour.



### **1. The ratio of apples to oranges in a basket is 5:3. If there are 35 apples, how many oranges are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 5:3 (apples to oranges)
* **Apples**: 35

We know that the number of apples and oranges are proportional, so let's set up a proportion:

$$
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{35}{x}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
5 \times x = 3 \times 35
$$
$$
5x = 105
$$
$$
x = \frac{105}{5} = 21
$$

So, the number of oranges is **21**. 

---

### **2. The ratio of red balls to blue balls in a box is 7:8. If there are 45 total balls in the box, how many red balls are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 7:8 (red balls to blue balls)
* **Total balls**: 45

Total parts = $7 + 8 = 15$ parts.
Each part represents $\frac{45}{15} = 3$ balls.

Now, the number of red balls:

$$
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ red balls}
$$

So, there are **21 red balls**. 

---

### **3. A car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons of gas. How far will it travel on 18 gallons of gas?**

This is an example of **direct proportion** because more gallons of gas should result in more miles traveled. We set up the proportion:

$$
\frac{180}{12} = \frac{x}{18}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
180 \times 18 = 12 \times x
$$
$$
3240 = 12x
$$
$$
x = \frac{3240}{12} = 270 \text{ miles}
$$

So, the car will travel **270 miles**. 

---

### **4. A chemist mixes two solutions in the ratio 4:5. If she has 48 liters of the first solution, how many liters of the second solution will she need to maintain the ratio?**

* **Given ratio**: 4:5 (first solution to second solution)
* **First solution**: 48 liters

Set up a proportion:

$$
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{48}{x}
$$

Cross-multiply:

$$
4x = 5 \times 48
$$
$$
4x = 240
$$
$$
x = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ liters}
$$

So, the chemist needs **60 liters** of the second solution. 

---

### **5. A company distributes profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 among three partners A, B, and C. If the total profit is $18,000, how much does each partner get?**

* **Given ratio**: 3:2:1 (A:B:C)
* **Total profit**: $18,000

First, find the total number of parts:

$$
3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \text{ parts}
$$

Each part is worth:

$$
\frac{18,000}{6} = 3,000
$$

Now, calculate each partner's share:

* A’s share: $3 \times 3,000 = 9,000$
* B’s share: $2 \times 3,000 = 6,000$
* C’s share: $1 \times 3,000 = 3,000$

So, each partner gets:

* **A**: $9,000
* **B**: $6,000
* **C**: $3,000

 Great use of the ratio and proportion here.

---

### **6. A group of students is divided into two categories, juniors and seniors, in the ratio 3:4. If 210 students are juniors, how many total students are there?**

* **Given ratio**: 3:4 (juniors to seniors)
* **Juniors**: 210

Let’s calculate the number of parts for juniors and seniors:

The ratio of juniors to seniors is 3:4, so the total parts are:

$$
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ parts}
$$

Each part represents:

$$
\frac{210}{3} = 70 \text{ students per part}
$$

Now calculate the number of seniors:

$$
4 \times 70 = 280 \text{ seniors}
$$

The total number of students is:

$$
210 + 280 = 490 \text{ students}
$$

 There are **490 students** in total.

---
### **7. A car travels 180 miles on 12 gallons of gas. What is the car's fuel efficiency (its unit rate)?**

$$\text{Unit Rate} = \frac{Distance}{Gallons}=\frac{180 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ gallons}} = 15 \text{ miles per gallons}$$

$$y = kx$$
$$Distance=15×Gallons$$
This 15 is the constant of proportionality, k.
