I'm leaning linear, single variable equations, i would like to master the basics before moving to next level like 2 variables

i would like to get comfortable with the below equations

This to understand how to simplify awkward looking equations

## Simplify

Refer this before

[Decimal to int division](../../Decimals/README.md#quick-way) For division converting to int and doing the operation give the same result, it won't change the equation

### 1.$$\left(\frac{2}{0.004x}\right) / \left(\frac{0.005}{0.1}\right)$$

Bring the denominator to numerator

$$\left(\frac{2}{0.004x}\right) \times \left(\frac{0.1}{0.005}\right)$$

> [!NOTE]  
> This is not a cencelling of denominator, this is kind of fraction division
> [Refer](../../Fractions/README.md#shortcut-for-fraction-division)

|Working on int|Working on decimal|
|:-------------|:-----------------|
|Convert to int available fractions are 0.1, 0.004, 0.005, The longest decimal is 0.00_ if we multiply 1000, all the decimals will be converted to int||
|$$=\frac{1000 \times 2}{1000 \times 0.004x} \times \frac{1000 \times 0.1}{1000 \times 0.005} $$ $$=\frac{2000}{4x} \times \frac{100}{5}$$ $$=\frac{500}{x} \times \frac{20}{1}$$ $$=\frac{10000}{x}$$| $$ = \frac{2 \times 0.1}{0.004x \times 0.005}$$ $$=\frac{0.2}{0.00002x}$$ $$\frac{10000}{x}$$|


>[!NOTE]  
>Clearing denominator is used in equation, when more than 1 term has denominator we find the LCM and clear the denominator  
>Fraction multiplication is used on single term to simplify the term

### 2.$$\left(\frac{2.2}{0.001}\right) / 2x$$

$$\left(\frac{2.2}{0.001}\right) / \frac{2x}{1}$$

$$\frac{2.2}{0.001} \times \frac{1}{2x} = \frac{2.2}{0.002x}$$
$$\frac{1100}{x}$$

---

### 3.  $$\frac{2.1}{\left(\frac{2.2}{0.0017}\right)x}$$

$$\frac{2.1}{1}/{\left(\frac{2.2}{0.0017}\right)x}$$
$$ = \frac{2.1 \times 0.0017}{2.2x}$$
$$= \frac{0.00357}{2.2x}$$
$$ = 0.001622727$$

4.  $$\frac{2.1}{\left(\frac{2.2}{\left(\frac{3}{0.4x}\right)}\right)}$$

1st work on inner most

$$\frac{2.2}{\frac{3}{0.4x}} = \frac{2.2 \times 0.4x}{1 \times 3} = \frac{0.88x}{3}$$

$$\frac{2.1}{\frac{0.88x}{3}} = \frac{2.1 \times 3}{1 \times 0.88x} = \frac{6.3}{0.88x}$$

---

5.  $$5 \left( \frac{0.12}{0.003} x - \frac{1}{0.2} \right) + 0.5x$$

Distributive

$$\frac{5\times 0.12x}{0.003} - \frac{5\times 1}{0.2} + 0.5x = \frac{0.6x}{0.003} -\frac{5}{0.2} + 0.5x$$

Simplify each

1. $$\frac{0.6x}{0.003} \text{Convert to int and do the division for easy} = \frac{600x}{3} = 200x$$

2. $$\frac{5}{0.2} \text{Convert to int and do the division for easy} = \frac{50}{2} = 25$$

New equation is

$$200x - 25 + 0.5x = 200.5x - 25$$

6.  $$\frac{1}{2x / \left( \frac{0.8}{4.2} \right)}$$

Simplify the Denominator (Division of the first two terms)

The denominator is $2x / \left( \frac{0.8}{4.2} \right)$.
Remember, **division by a fraction is multiplication by its reciprocal.**

$$2x / \left( \frac{0.8}{4.2} \right) = 2x \times \left( \frac{4.2}{0.8} \right)$$


Simplify the fraction $\frac{4.2}{0.8}$. To clear the decimals, multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:
$$\frac{4.2 \times 10}{0.8 \times 10} = \frac{42}{8}$$

Simplify $\frac{42}{8}$ by dividing both by $2$:
$$\frac{42 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \mathbf{\frac{21}{4}}$$

Rewrite the Simplified Denominator

Substitute the simplified ratio back into the denominator expression:
$$2x \times \frac{21}{4} = \frac{2 \times 21}{4} x = \frac{42}{4} x$$

Simplify $\frac{42}{4}$ by dividing both by $2$:
$$\frac{42 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{21}{2}$$

The entire denominator simplifies to:
$$\mathbf{\frac{21}{2} x}$$

Rewrite the Main Expression

Substitute the simplified denominator back into the main fraction:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{21x}{2}}$$

 Final Simplification (Reciprocal of the Reciprocal)

This expression is $1$ divided by $\frac{21x}{2}$. Applying the reciprocal rule one last time:

$$1 \div \frac{21x}{2} = 1 \times \frac{2}{21x}$$


$$\frac{2}{21x}$$

7.  $$3x - 1.5 \left( \frac{1}{\frac{0.4}{5x}} \right)$$

Inner term

$$\frac{1}{\frac{0.4}{5x}} = 1 \times \frac{5x}{0.4} = \mathbf{\frac{5x}{0.4}}$$

Combine
$$3x - 1.5 \left( \frac{5x}{0.4} \right)$$

First, simplify $\frac{5}{0.4}$:
$$\frac{5x}{0.4} = \frac{50x}{4} = \mathbf{12.5x}$$

Now multiply by $1.5$:
$$1.5 \times 12.5x = \mathbf{18.75x}$$

The expression is now:
$$3x - 18.75x$$

$$3x - 18.75x = (3 - 18.75)x = \mathbf{-15.75x}$$

$$-15.75x$$
