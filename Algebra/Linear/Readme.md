# Linear Equation

## What is a Linear Equation?

A linear equation is an algebraic equation of degree one, meaning the highest exponent of any variable in the equation is 1. When graphed, a linear equation always forms a straight line .

Purpose: It models relationships where the rate of change is constant. For every fixed increase in one quantity, the other quantity changes by a proportional, fixed amount.

### Where it is used?

1. Computer Graphics and Geometry
    
    Drawing lines and basic shapes, especially in 2D graphics engines.

    An algorithm called DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) or Bresenham's Line Algorithm uses concepts derived from the slope-intercept form (y=mx+b) to determine which pixels should be lit up between two points to form a perfect straight line on a screen.

2. Memory Addressing

    Accessing data stored in a simple list or array in a computer's memory.

    The memory address of the n-th element in an array is calculated using a linear relationship:
    $$\text{Address} = \text{Base Address} + \text{n} \times \text{Size of one element}$$

## Types of Linear equation

### 1. One Variable	


1. $$x−5.7=−1.2$$

Convert to integer: It is /10 decimal, so multiply by 10

$$10x (-5.7 \times 10) = -1.2 \times 10$$

$$10x-57=-12$$

Isolate x by removing -57 by addding +57
$$10x -57 + 57 = -12 + 57$$
$$10x = 45$$

Isolate x, by divide 10
$$\frac{10x}{10} = \frac{45}{10}$$
$$x=4.5$$

**Verify the solution**  

Substitute the x in place


$$4.5-5.7=-1.2$$
$$-1.2=-1.2 \text{ It is proved}$$

2. $$y+\frac{5}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$$

Find LCM of 8,4 = 8

$$\frac{y \times 8}{1 \times 8} + \frac{5 \times 1}{8 \times 1} = \frac{1 \times 2}{4 \times 2}$$

$$\frac{8y}{8} + \frac{5}{8} = \frac{2}{8}$$

Remove /8 by multiplying 8
$$\frac{8}{1}*\frac{8y}{8} + \frac{8}{1}*\frac{5}{8} = \frac{8}{1}* \frac{2}{8}$$

$$8y + 5 = 2$$

Combine constants

$$8y=2-5$$
$$8y=-3$$

Isolate y by divide 8

$$\frac{8y}{8}=\frac{-3}{8}$$
$$y=\frac{-3}{8}$$

**Verify**

$$\frac{-3}{8}+\frac{5}{8} = \frac{1}{4}$$
$$\frac{2}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$$
Simplify
$$\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{4}$$
