## What is Algebra?
it's essentially the study of mathematical relationships, structures, and quantity.

* *relationship*: A Relationship shows how one quantity depends on or connects to another quantity. This is usually expressed as an equation.

    Example:  
    This as a taxi ride, $y=2x+5$  
    The Cost (y) is the total money you pay.  
    The Distance (x) is how far you travel.  
    The relationship might be: $\text{Cost} = (2 × \text{Distance}) + 5$  
    If the distance (x) changes, the cost (y) must change too.

* *structures*: The rules you must follow to solve the equation.

    Example:  
    - Commutative Property:  
        You can switch the order of numbers when adding or multiplying without changing the answer.	
        $a+b=b+a (e.g., 3+5\text{ is the same as }5+3)$
    - Distributive Property:
        You can multiply a number outside parentheses by everything inside them.	
        $a(b+c)=ab+ac (e.g., 2(x+3)=2x+6)$

* *Quantity*: The numbers and letters (knowns and unknowns).

    Example:
    $y = 2 + x$
    -  Known Quantity (The Numbers), 2 is Known qunatity
    -  Unknown Quantity (The Variables), x is unknown
    -  General Quantity  
        This is a quantity that can represent any number, used to state a rule or property.
        $a+b=b+a$



At its most fundamental level, algebra is about solving problems where you don't know all the numbers. Instead of just working with specific numbers (like 3+5=8), algebra introduces variables, which are symbols (usually letters like x or y) that represent an unknown quantity.

Arithmetic Example: $3 + \text{\_} = 8$  

Algebraic Example: $3+\text{x}=8$

The goal of algebra is to use various rules and operations to figure out what x must be. (In this simple case, x=5).

## Key Concepts in Algebra
1.  **Variables:** Symbols, usually letters (like $x, y, a, b$), that stand for an unknown number or a set of numbers.
2.  **Expressions:** A combination of numbers, variables, and operation signs (like $2x + 5$ or $a^2 - 3b$).
3.  **Equations:** A statement that two expressions are equal (like $2x + 5 = 15$). The key is the equals sign ($=$).
4.  **Functions:** A rule that relates one set of values (the input) to another set of values (the output) in such a way that each input has exactly one output. A common example is $f(x) = 2x$, where the output is always double the input.
5.  **Graphing:** Using a coordinate system (like the **Cartesian Plane**) to visually represent algebraic relationships, such as lines or curves.

## Why is Algebra Important?

Algebra is far more than just manipulating letters. It provides a universal language for problem-solving across all sciences and many aspects of daily life:

* **Logic and Problem Solving:** It trains your brain to think logically and systematically to solve complex problems by breaking them down into steps.
* **Science:** All of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science use algebraic formulas and equations to describe natural laws and build technology. For example, the famous formula $E = mc^2$ is an algebraic equation.
* **Finance:** It's used in calculating interest, loan payments, investments, and more.
* **Technology:** The algorithms that power computers, video games, and even search engines are based on algebraic principles.

In short, algebra is the **bridge** between simple arithmetic and the more complex mathematics (like calculus and statistics) that describe our world.

## Foundations of Algebra

### Variables

A variable is the fundamental concept in algebra that allows us to generalize mathematical relationships. It is essentially a placeholder for a value that can change or is unknown.

Variables are the building blocks of algebraic expressions and equations

A variable is a symbol, typically a letter (like $x, y, a,$ or $t$), used to represent a number.

| Feature | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unknown Value** | It stands for a specific number that we are trying to find in an equation. | In $x + 5 = 12$, $x$ is the unknown value. |
| **Changing Quantity** | It represents a quantity whose value varies in a function or a formula. | In the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \pi r^2$, $r$ (radius) and $A$ (area) are variables. |
| **Generalization** | It allows us to express a mathematical rule that works for *any* number. | The commutative property of addition, $a + b = b + a$, uses variables to show the rule works for any two numbers $a$ and $b$. |

It's important to distinguish variables from **constants**:

* **Variable:** A symbol representing a value that *can* change. (e.g., $x, y$).
* **Constant:** A symbol or number representing a fixed value that *does not* change. (e.g., $3, -10$).

In the expression $3x + 4$:
* $x$ is the **variable**.
* $3$ is the **coefficient** (a constant that multiplies the variable).
* $4$ is the **constant term**.

### Expression
* An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables, and operation symbols (+, −, ×, $\div$).
* It does not have $=$ symbol
* Eg: $5x, y−7, 2a+3b$

| English Phrase | Algebraic Expression |
| :--- | :--- |
| A number increased by 10 | x+10 |
| 7 less than a number | y−7 |
| Twice a number | 2a or 2×a |
| The quotient of a number and 4 |  $\frac{b}{4}$ or b÷4 |
| 3 times a number, minus 5 | 3n−5 |

### Equations
The moment an expression is set equal to a value or another expression, it becomes an equation, and you can now solve it!

An algebraic equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. It must contain an equals sign (=).

The equals sign is like a balance scale . Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it balanced.

Examples: $x+10=15, 2a=8, 3n−5=10$

**What is balanced equation?**

Imagine you are ordering pizza for a party
  

* A large pizza cost: \$15
* They gave you one time copun which is worth of \$5 for free
* The total cost you spend is \$50

From the items you bought we know you spent \$50 for some pizza each costs \$15 , From the statement we don't know how many pizza you bought so

- Unknow variable x is: the pizza you bought
- Constant is copun

Left side you will arrange all the spend items

$$(15 \times x) - 5$$

what you bought will come on the left side of the equation, 
why in equation has -5, what -means?
The things you bought is + and the offeres, returns are in -

the amount will come on the right side of the equation
$$=50$$

So equation is $$(15 \times x) - 5 = 50$$

The equation shows that the cost of the pizzas minus the coupon is equal to the total money spent. This shows the equation is balanced

The equation $15x−5=50$ is the balanced statement. It accurately reflects the relationship between the price, the coupon, and the total cost. If the spending increasing on one side, other side of the equation also get affected.   
Since the equation is balanced what ever happen on one side will affect the other side

## Algebric inversion 

**why moving in other side of the equation we are changeing multiply to divide, divide to multiply?**

We don't actually "move" the term; we perform the inverse operation on both sides of the equation to cancel the term on one side.

Let's look at an example to see why multiplication changes to division:
#### Find the price of one pen if 5 pens cost $20.

$$5 \times x = 20$$

$$5 \rarr \text{Number of pens}$$
$$x \rarr \text{Cost of 1 pen}$$
$$20 \rarr \text{Cost of 20 pens}$$

The goal of solving an equation is to isolate the variable (x) on one side of the equals sign. To achieve this, you must cancel out all other terms affecting x by performing the inverse operation. To maintain the equality of the equation, every operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other.

We want to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 5, the only way to cancel the "×5" is by dividing by 5.

1. Divide both side by 5:

$$\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{20}{5}$$

2. The 5s on the left cancel out (because 5÷5=1, and 1×x=x):

$$x=\frac{20}{5}$$

3. $$x = 4$$


The Core Rule: Why We Must Do It on Both Sides

The equals sign (=) in an equation means that the expression on the left side has the exact same value as the expression on the right side.

* If you change the weight on one side of a balanced scale (e.g., you divide the weight on the left by 5), the scale will tip and be unbalanced.

* To keep the scale perfectly balanced (i.e., to keep the equation true), you must perform the exact same change (divide the weight on the right by 5) to the other side.

### Other rules

1. $x + 7 = 15$  
x is combined with +7, to eliminate we have to do $-7$ in both side

$$x + 7 -7 = 15 - 7 $$
$$x = 15 - 7 = 8$$

2. $x - 7 = 15$  
x is combined with -7, to eliminate we have to do $+7$ in both side

$$x - 7 + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22$$

3. $\frac{x}{5} = 15$

x is on divide, to cancel out $\frac{}{5}$ we have to do $\times 5 $ on both side

$$ \frac{x}{5}  \times 5= 15 \times 5$$
$$x = 15 \times 5 = 75$$

## Order of Operations for Solving Equations

### Simplification (The Pre-Inversion Steps)

The goal here is to reduce the equation to the clean

See also [properties](../properties/README.md)

**1. Distribute**

Use the **Distributive Property** to eliminate all parentheses.

You cannot solve an equation with variables locked inside parentheses.

* $$a(b+c) = ab+ac$$
* $$a(b−c) = ab−ac$$
* $$(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$$

*How it help?*

Standard Approach: Calculate $6×43$ directly. Difficult to do mentally.

Distributive Property Approach: $6×(40+3)$ = $(6×40)+(6×3)$, Easier mental calculation.

**2. Combine Like Terms (Cleanup on Each Side)**

Combining like terms simplifies the appearance of the equation. You deal with each side separately before you use the Properties of Equality to move terms across the equals sign.

$$5x+7−2x+10=25$$
$$\text{Combine x-terms}$$
$$5x-2x = 3x$$
$$3x+7+10=25$$
$$\text{Combine constants}$$
$$7+10=17$$
$$3x+17=25$$

$$5x+7−2x+10=25 \text{ is equal to } 3x+17=25$$


**3. Balance Variables** 

Balancing variables is the step where you reorganize the equation to gather all the terms with the unknown variable (like x) onto one side and all the plain numbers (constants) onto the other side. This prepares the equation for the final solving steps.


$$5x+2=2x+8$$

The variable x appears on both sides of the equals sign. You can't solve for x when it's mixed up on both the left and the right.

1. Move the Variable Term	

We usually move the variable term with the smaller coefficient to the other side to keep the result positive. In this case, move the 2x term.	

We use the inverse operation (subtraction) to eliminate 2x from the right side.

$$5x−2x+2=2x−2x+8$$

$$3x+2=8$$

2. Move the Constant Term	

The equation is now in the two-step format (ax+b=c). We now move the constant term (+2) away from the x term.	

$$3x+2−2=8−2$$

$$3x=6$$


**Example Flow:**

$$4(x - 1) + 2x = 20$$
$$\downarrow \text{1. Distribute}$$
$$4x - 4 + 2x = 20$$
$$\downarrow \text{2. Combine Like Terms}$$
$$6x - 4 = 20 \quad \text{(Now a Two-Step Equation)}$$
$$\downarrow \text{4. Undo Subtraction (Add 4)}$$
$$6x = 24$$
$$\downarrow \text{5. Undo Multiplication (Divide by 6)}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 4}$$

## Additional clearing

### 1. Handling Fractions and Decimals

While you can solve equations that contain fractions or decimals directly, it's often easier to eliminate them at the very start of the problem. This makes the remaining equation cleaner and simpler to solve.

#### A. Clearing Fractions (The Multiplier Method)

To eliminate fractions, multiply **every single term** in the entire equation by the **Least Common Denominator (LCD) or Least Common Multiplier(LCM)** of all the fractions.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{6}}$

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are 2, 3, and 6. The LCD is **6**.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by the LCD (6):**
    $$\left( \frac{1}{2}x \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)$$
    Expaneded way,LCM is 6  (either follow expanded way or simple way)
    -----------------------
    $$\frac{1 \times 3}{2 \times 3}x + \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2}=\frac{5 \times 1}{6 \times 1}$$
    $$\frac{3}{6}x + \frac{4}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$$
    Now elminate 6 by multiplying 6

    $$\frac{6}{1}*\frac{3}{6}x +\frac{6}{1}* \frac{4}{6}=\frac{6}{1}*\frac{5}{6}$$

    $$3x + 4 = 5$$

    simple way (either follow expanded way or simple way)
    ----------

    $$ \frac{6}{1} * \frac{1}{2}x  +  \frac{6}{1} * \frac{2}{3}  =  \frac{6}{1} * \frac{5}{6} $$
    $$ \frac{6}{2} x  +  \frac{12}{3}  =  \frac{30}{6}$$


    Simplify (Cancel Denominators):
    $$3x + 4 = 5$$
    Now you have a clean two-step equation to solve!

>[!NOTE]  
> Here LCM is applied to both RHS and LHS because we are clearing the denominator, after applying LCM equation is balanced, it is in another form, so no need to balance the equation  
> $0.75 == \frac{3}{4}$ , $0.50 == \frac{1}{2} == \frac{5}{10}, \cdots$ These are some simple examples we are just changing the form

#### B. Clearing Decimals (Multiplying by a Power of 10)

To eliminate decimals, look for the term with the most decimal places and multiply **every term** by the corresponding power of $10$ (10, 100, 1000, etc.).

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{0.25x - 1.5 = 3}$

1.  **Identify the Multiplier:** The term $0.25x$ has the most decimal places (two). So, we multiply everything by $\mathbf{100}$.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by 100:**
    $$100(0.25x) - 100(1.5) = 100(3)$$
3.  **Simplify:**
    $$25x - 150 = 300$$
        Again, this results in a much easier two-step equation using only integers.
    divide by 25 to simplify further
    $$\frac{25}{25}x - \frac{150}{25} = \frac{300}{25}$$
    $$x-6=12$$
    Isolate x, by adding 6
    $$x-6+6=12+6$$
    $$x=18$$

> [!NOTE]  
> Here after multiplying with 100 the equation is changes, so we must balance the equation, so we are doing for both the side, $0.25 \neq 25 \neq 2.5 \neq 250 \cdots$

---

### 2. Special Cases: No Solution or Infinite Solutions

Most linear equations have one single solution (like $x=5$). However, some equations are either *always true* or *never true*. These special cases only become apparent after you simplify and start to balance the variable terms.

#### A. No Solution (Contradiction)

This happens when you arrive at a false statement.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{2x + 5 = 2x + 10}$

1.  **Subtract $2x$ from both sides** (Balance the variable term):
    $$5 = 10$$
2.  **Analyze:** Since $5$ is *not* equal to $10$, this equation is a **contradiction**. No value of $x$ will ever make it true.
3.  **Conclusion:** The equation has **No Solution**.

#### B. Infinite Solutions (Identity)

This happens when you arrive at a true statement.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{3(x + 1) = 3x + 3}$

1.  **Distribute:**
    $$3x + 3 = 3x + 3$$
2.  **Subtract $3x$ from both sides:**
    $$3 = 3$$
3.  **Analyze:** Since $3$ is *always* equal to $3$, this equation is an **identity**. It is true for every possible value of $x$.
4.  **Conclusion:** The equation has **Infinite Solutions** (or "All Real Numbers").


## Solving equation
The central goal in solving any equation is to use inverse operations and the Properties of Equality to isolate the variable (e.g., x) on one side of the equation.


#### Techniques for solving .

1. **One-step inversion**

One-step equations require a single inverse operation to solve for the variable.

| Equation Type | Example | Inverse Operation | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Addition** | $$x + 9 = 15$$| **Subtract 9** from both sides. |$$x = 15 - 9$$ $$x = 6$$ |
| **Subtraction** | $$y - 4 = 10$$| **Add 4** to both sides. |$$y = 10 + 4$$ $$y = 14$$ |
| **Multiplication** | $$3m = 21$$| **Divide by 3** on both sides. |$$m = \frac{21}{3}$$ $$m = 7$$ |
| **Division** | $$\frac{a}{5} = 7$$| **Multiply by 5** on both sides. |$$a = 7 \times 5$$ $$a = 35$$ |


2. **Two-step inversion**

Two-step equations involve a variable that is being affected by **two** operations (usually multiplication/division AND addition/subtraction). You must undo the operations in the reverse order of operations (like PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**Rule:** Always undo the **addition/subtraction** first, and then undo the **multiplication/division**.
**Why Inverse in reverse?**

To isolate x, you must remove the operations affecting it, starting with the one that was applied last. Think of it like unwrapping a gift

#### Example: Solve $4x + 7 = 19$

| Step | Operation on $x$ | Action | Equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Original** | $x$ is multiplied by 4, then 7 is added. | | $$4x + 7 = 19$$ |
| **Step 1: Undo Addition** | Undo $+7$ by **subtracting 7** from both sides. | $4x + 7 - 7 = 19 - 7$ | $$4x = 12$$ |
| **Step 2: Undo Multiplication** | Undo $\times 4$ by **dividing by 4** on both sides. | $\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{12}{4}$ | $$\mathbf{x = 3}$$ |

3. **Multi-step inversion**

Multi-step equations are linear equations that require three or more steps to solve. These often involve:
1.  **Distribution** (to clear parentheses).
2.  **Combining Like Terms** (on the same side).
3.  **Balancing Variables** (moving variables to one side).
4.  **Two-Step Inversion** (the final steps).

**General Procedure (Simplify, Balance, Solve):**

1.  **Simplify Each Side:**
    * **Distribute** to eliminate parentheses. 
    * **Combine Like Terms** on the left side, then on the right side.
2.  **Balance Variables:**
    * Use **addition or subtraction** to move all variable terms (e.g., $x$) to one side of the equation.
3.  **Balance Constants:**
    * Use **addition or subtraction** to move all plain numbers (constants) to the opposite side.
4.  **Solve:**
    * Use **multiplication or division** to isolate the variable.

**Why this order?**

By distributing first, you clear the structural barrier, allowing all terms to stand alone. Once the terms are free, you can begin the process of combining and balancing them.

Example: In $4(x−1)+2x=20$

You can't combine the x inside the parentheses with the 2x outside until you perform the multiplication (the distribution) first $4x−4+2x=20$

| Order | Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st** | **Distribute** | Eliminate parentheses |
| **2nd** | **Combine Like Terms** | Simplify the look of *each side* of the equation separately. |
| **3rd** | **Balance Variables** | Move all $x$ terms to one side. |
| **4th** | **Balance Constants** | Move all plain numbers to the other side (Sets up the Two-Step form). |
| **5th** | **Solve (Inversion)** | Undo addition/subtraction, then multiplication/division. |

#### Example: Solve $5(x - 2) + 3x = 2x + 14$

| Step | Action | Equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Original** | | $$5(x - 2) + 3x = 2x + 14$$ |
| **1. Distribute** | Apply $5$ to $(x-2)$. | $$5x - 10 + 3x = 2x + 14$$ |
| **2. Combine Like Terms** | Combine $5x$ and $3x$ on the left side. | $$8x - 10 = 2x + 14$$ |
| **3. Balance Variables** | Subtract $2x$ from both sides (to move variables left). | $$6x - 10 = 14$$ |
| **4. Balance Constants** | Add $10$ to both sides (to move constants right). | $$6x = 24$$ |
| **5. Solve** | Divide both sides by $6$. | $$\mathbf{x = 4}$$ |

## Types of Equation
Algebraic equations are categorized based on the highest power (or degree) of the variable. The degree dictates the shape of the graph, the complexity of the solution process, and, crucially, the number of solutions the equation will have


### Finding the Degree

The method for finding the degree depends on whether the polynomial has one variable or multiple variables.

#### 1. For an Equation with One Variable

The degree is simply the **largest exponent** of the variable in any term.

| Degree | Name | General Form (Example) | Highest Power |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | **Linear** Equation | $2x + 5 = 0$ | $x^1$ |
| 2 | **Quadratic** Equation | $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$ | $x^2$ |
| 3 | **Cubic** Equation | $4x^3 + x^2 - 7 = 0$ | $x^3$ |
| 4 | **Quartic** Equation | $x^4 - 2x = 9$ | $x^4$ |
| 5 | **Quintic** Equation | $-x^5 + 8x^3 = 0$ | $x^5$ |



#### 2. For an Equation with Multiple Variables

The degree is the **highest sum of the exponents** of the variables in any single term.

**Example: $5x^3y^2 + 7x^4 + 2xy = 10$**

1.  **Find the degree of each term:**
    * $5x^3y^2$: The exponents are 3 and 2. Sum: $3 + 2 = \mathbf{5}$.
    * $7x^4$: The exponent is 4. Sum: $\mathbf{4}$.
    * $2xy$: The exponents are 1 and 1. Sum: $1 + 1 = \mathbf{2}$.
2.  **The degree of the equation** is the largest of these sums, which is **5**.


### Importance of the Degree

The degree of an equation is crucial because it generally determines:

* **The maximum number of roots (solutions):** A polynomial equation of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real solutions.
    * *Example:* A **Quadratic** equation (degree 2) has at most two real solutions.
* **The shape of the graph:** The degree influences the general shape and "end behavior" (what the graph does as $x$ approaches positive and negative infinity) of the function when graphed.
    * *Example:* **Linear** equations (degree 1) always graph as a straight line. **Quadratic** equations (degree 2) always graph as a parabola .


### Where Algebraic Equations Are Used

The degree of an equation determines its complexity and, therefore, the types of real-world phenomena it can accurately model.

#### 1. Linear Equations (Degree 1)

Linear equations are used for modeling relationships where the **change is constant**—a straight-line relationship.

| Application Field | How it's Used | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Finance** | Calculating simple interest, costs, or budgeting over time. | $\text{Total Cost} = (\text{Rate} \times \text{Hours}) + \text{Flat Fee}$ |
| **Physics** | Modeling motion at a constant speed. | $\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$ (where rate is constant) |
| **Geometry** | Calculating the perimeter of shapes. | $\text{Perimeter} = 2l + 2w$ |
| **Business** | Determining a break-even point in sales where the cost and revenue lines cross. |

#### 2. Quadratic Equations (Degree 2)

Quadratic equations are essential for modeling situations involving **gravity, area, and optimization**. Their parabolic shape captures the idea of something going up and then coming back down, or reaching a maximum/minimum point.

| Application Field | How it's Used | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physics/Engineering** | Modeling the **trajectory** of projectiles (balls, rockets, water from a hose). | An equation for the height of a ball thrown into the air over time.  |
| **Area & Design** | Designing large structures like satellite dishes, bridges, or car headlights, which use parabolic reflectors. | Finding the maximum area you can enclose with a fixed amount of fencing. |
| **Economics** | Determining the **maximum profit** or the point of diminishing returns for a product. |

#### 3. Cubic Equations (Degree 3)

Cubic equations model situations that require **a turn and a change of direction**, such as volumes or complex growth patterns.

| Application Field | How it's Used | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volume** | Calculating the volume of three-dimensional objects where dimensions are variable. | $\text{Volume} = l \times w \times h$ (if $l, w, h$ are related to $x$) |
| **Engineering** | Designing the smooth curves and surfaces for car bodies, airplane wings, or roller coaster tracks. | Modeling the change in temperature of a metal object as it cools. |
| **Medicine** | Creating mathematical models of biological growth, like the spread of a virus or the growth of a cell population. |

#### 4. Quartic and Quintic Equations (Degree 4 and 5)

Higher-degree polynomials are typically used in **advanced scientific and computational fields** where complex, multiple variables interact, leading to several turning points in the graph.

| Application Field | How it's Used | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Computer Graphics** | Used extensively in **Cubic Splines** and **Bezier Curves** to create the smooth, realistic motion and shapes in video games and animation. | Defining the flight path of a digital bird in a video game that needs to curve up, down, and then sharply up again. |
| **Modeling** | Solving intricate problems in chemistry, quantum mechanics, and cosmology where systems have multiple energy states or equilibrium points. | Modeling the position of robotic arms with multiple joints (kinematics). |
