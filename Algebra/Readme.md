## What is Algebra?
it's essentially the study of mathematical relationships, structures, and quantity.

* *relationship*: A Relationship shows how one quantity depends on or connects to another quantity. This is usually expressed as an equation.

    Example:  
    This as a taxi ride, $y=2x+5$  
    The Cost (y) is the total money you pay.  
    The Distance (x) is how far you travel.  
    The relationship might be: $\text{Cost} = (2 × \text{Distance}) + 5$  
    If the distance (x) changes, the cost (y) must change too.

* *structures*: The rules you must follow to solve the equation.

    Example:  
    - Commutative Property:  
        You can switch the order of numbers when adding or multiplying without changing the answer.	
        $a+b=b+a (e.g., 3+5\text{ is the same as }5+3)$
    - Distributive Property:
        You can multiply a number outside parentheses by everything inside them.	
        $a(b+c)=ab+ac (e.g., 2(x+3)=2x+6)$

* *Quantity*: The numbers and letters (knowns and unknowns).

    Example:
    $y = 2 + x$
    -  Known Quantity (The Numbers), 2 is Known qunatity
    -  Unknown Quantity (The Variables), x is unknown
    -  General Quantity  
        This is a quantity that can represent any number, used to state a rule or property.
        $a+b=b+a$



At its most fundamental level, algebra is about solving problems where you don't know all the numbers. Instead of just working with specific numbers (like 3+5=8), algebra introduces variables, which are symbols (usually letters like x or y) that represent an unknown quantity.

Arithmetic Example: $3 + \text{\_} = 8$  

Algebraic Example: $3+\text{x}=8$

The goal of algebra is to use various rules and operations to figure out what x must be. (In this simple case, x=5).

## Key Concepts in Algebra
1.  **Variables:** Symbols, usually letters (like $x, y, a, b$), that stand for an unknown number or a set of numbers.
2.  **Expressions:** A combination of numbers, variables, and operation signs (like $2x + 5$ or $a^2 - 3b$).
3.  **Equations:** A statement that two expressions are equal (like $2x + 5 = 15$). The key is the equals sign ($=$).
4.  **Functions:** A rule that relates one set of values (the input) to another set of values (the output) in such a way that each input has exactly one output. A common example is $f(x) = 2x$, where the output is always double the input.
5.  **Graphing:** Using a coordinate system (like the **Cartesian Plane**) to visually represent algebraic relationships, such as lines or curves.

## Why is Algebra Important?

Algebra is far more than just manipulating letters. It provides a universal language for problem-solving across all sciences and many aspects of daily life:

* **Logic and Problem Solving:** It trains your brain to think logically and systematically to solve complex problems by breaking them down into steps.
* **Science:** All of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science use algebraic formulas and equations to describe natural laws and build technology. For example, the famous formula $E = mc^2$ is an algebraic equation.
* **Finance:** It's used in calculating interest, loan payments, investments, and more.
* **Technology:** The algorithms that power computers, video games, and even search engines are based on algebraic principles.

In short, algebra is the **bridge** between simple arithmetic and the more complex mathematics (like calculus and statistics) that describe our world.

## Foundations of Algebra

### Variables

A variable is the fundamental concept in algebra that allows us to generalize mathematical relationships. It is essentially a placeholder for a value that can change or is unknown.

Variables are the building blocks of algebraic expressions and equations

A variable is a symbol, typically a letter (like $x, y, a,$ or $t$), used to represent a number.

| Feature | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unknown Value** | It stands for a specific number that we are trying to find in an equation. | In $x + 5 = 12$, $x$ is the unknown value. |
| **Changing Quantity** | It represents a quantity whose value varies in a function or a formula. | In the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \pi r^2$, $r$ (radius) and $A$ (area) are variables. |
| **Generalization** | It allows us to express a mathematical rule that works for *any* number. | The commutative property of addition, $a + b = b + a$, uses variables to show the rule works for any two numbers $a$ and $b$. |

It's important to distinguish variables from **constants**:

* **Variable:** A symbol representing a value that *can* change. (e.g., $x, y$).
* **Constant:** A symbol or number representing a fixed value that *does not* change. (e.g., $3, -10$).

In the expression $3x + 4$:
* $x$ is the **variable**.
* $3$ is the **coefficient** (a constant that multiplies the variable).
* $4$ is the **constant term**.

### Expression
* An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables, and operation symbols (+, −, ×, $\div$).
* It does not have $=$ symbol
* Eg: $5x, y−7, 2a+3b$

| English Phrase | Algebraic Expression |
| :--- | :--- |
| A number increased by 10 | x+10 |
| 7 less than a number | y−7 |
| Twice a number | 2a or 2×a |
| The quotient of a number and 4 |  $\frac{b}{4}$ or b÷4 |
| 3 times a number, minus 5 | 3n−5 |

### Equations
The moment an expression is set equal to a value or another expression, it becomes an equation, and you can now solve it!

An algebraic equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. It must contain an equals sign (=).

The equals sign is like a balance scale . Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it balanced.

Examples: $x+10=15, 2a=8, 3n−5=10$

**What is balanced equation?**

Imagine you are ordering pizza for a party
  

* A large pizza cost: \$15
* They gave you one time copun which is worth of \$5 for free
* The total cost you spend is \$50

From the items you bought we know you spent \$50 for some pizza each costs \$15 , From the statement we don't know how many pizza you bought so

- Unknow variable x is: the pizza you bought
- Constant is copun

Left side you will arrange all the spend items

$$(15 \times x) - 5$$

what you bought will come on the left side of the equation, 
why in equation has -5, what -means?
The things you bought is + and the offeres, returns are in -

the amount will come on the right side of the equation
$$=50$$

So equation is $$(15 \times x) - 5 = 50$$

The equation shows that the cost of the pizzas minus the coupon is equal to the total money spent. This shows the equation is balanced

The equation $15x−5=50$ is the balanced statement. It accurately reflects the relationship between the price, the coupon, and the total cost. Since the equation is balanced what ever happen on one side will affect the other side

### Order of Operations for Solving Equations

#### Simplification (The Pre-Inversion Steps)

The goal here is to reduce the equation to the clean, two-step format: $ax + b = c$.

See also [properties](../properties/README.md)

**1. Distribute**

Use the **Distributive Property** to eliminate all parentheses.

You cannot solve an equation with variables locked inside parentheses.

* $$a(b+c)=ab+ac$$
* $$a(b−c)=ab−ac$$

Standard Approach: Calculate $6×43$ directly. Difficult to do mentally.

Distributive Property Approach: $6×(40+3)$ = $(6×40)+(6×3)$, Easier mental calculation.

**2. Combine Like Terms (Cleanup on Each Side)**

Combining like terms simplifies the appearance of the equation. You deal with each side separately before you use the Properties of Equality to move terms across the equals sign.

$$5x+7−2x+10=25$$
$$\text{Combine x-terms}$$
$$5x-2x = 3x$$
$$3x+7+10=25$$
$$\text{Combine constants}$$
$$7+10=17$$
$$3x+17=25$$

$$5x+7−2x+10=25 \text{ is equal to } 3x+17=25$$


**3. Balance Variables** 

Balancing variables is the step where you reorganize the equation to gather all the terms with the unknown variable (like x) onto one side and all the plain numbers (constants) onto the other side. This prepares the equation for the final solving steps.


$$5x+2=2x+8$$

The variable x appears on both sides of the equals sign. You can't solve for x when it's mixed up on both the left and the right.

1. Move the Variable Term	

We usually move the variable term with the smaller coefficient to the other side to keep the result positive. In this case, move the 2x term.	

We use the inverse operation (subtraction) to eliminate 2x from the right side.

$$5x−2x+2=2x−2x+8$$

$$3x+2=8$$

2. Move the Constant Term	

The equation is now in the two-step format (ax+b=c). We now move the constant term (+2) away from the x term.	

$$3x+2−2=8−2$$

$$3x=6$$


**Example Flow:**

$$4(x - 1) + 2x = 20$$
$$\downarrow \text{1. Distribute}$$
$$4x - 4 + 2x = 20$$
$$\downarrow \text{2. Combine Like Terms}$$
$$6x - 4 = 20 \quad \text{(Now a Two-Step Equation)}$$
$$\downarrow \text{4. Undo Subtraction (Add 4)}$$
$$6x = 24$$
$$\downarrow \text{5. Undo Multiplication (Divide by 6)}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 4}$$

## Additional clearing

### 1. Handling Fractions and Decimals

While you can solve equations that contain fractions or decimals directly, it's often easier to eliminate them at the very start of the problem. This makes the remaining equation cleaner and simpler to solve.

#### A. Clearing Fractions (The Multiplier Method)

To eliminate fractions, multiply **every single term** in the entire equation by the **Least Common Denominator (LCD) or Least Common Multiplier(LCM)** of all the fractions.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{6}}$

1.  **Find the LCD:** The denominators are 2, 3, and 6. The LCD is **6**.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by the LCD (6):**
    $$\left( \frac{1}{2}x \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)$$
    Expaneded way,LCM is 6  (either follow expanded way or simple way)
    -----------------------
    $$\frac{1 \times 3}{2 \times 3}x + \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2}=\frac{5 \times 1}{6 \times 1}$$
    $$\frac{3}{6}x + \frac{4}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$$
    Now elminate 6 by multiplying 6

    $$\frac{6}{1}*\frac{3}{6}x +\frac{6}{1}* \frac{4}{6}=\frac{6}{1}*\frac{5}{6}$$

    $$3x + 4 = 5$$

    simple way (either follow expanded way or simple way)
    ----------

    $$ \frac{6}{1} * \frac{1}{2}x  +  \frac{6}{1} * \frac{2}{3}  =  \frac{6}{1} * \frac{5}{6} $$
    $$ \frac{6}{2} x  +  \frac{12}{3}  =  \frac{30}{6}$$


3.  **Simplify (Cancel Denominators):**
    $$3x + 4 = 5$$
    Now you have a clean two-step equation to solve!

#### B. Clearing Decimals (Multiplying by a Power of 10)

To eliminate decimals, look for the term with the most decimal places and multiply **every term** by the corresponding power of $10$ (10, 100, 1000, etc.).

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{0.25x - 1.5 = 3}$

1.  **Identify the Multiplier:** The term $0.25x$ has the most decimal places (two). So, we multiply everything by $\mathbf{100}$.
2.  **Multiply Every Term by 100:**
    $$100(0.25x) - 100(1.5) = 100(3)$$
3.  **Simplify:**
    $$25x - 150 = 300$$
    Again, this results in a much easier two-step equation using only integers.

### 2. Special Cases: No Solution or Infinite Solutions

Most linear equations have one single solution (like $x=5$). However, some equations are either *always true* or *never true*. These special cases only become apparent after you simplify and start to balance the variable terms.

#### A. No Solution (Contradiction)

This happens when you arrive at a false statement.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{2x + 5 = 2x + 10}$

1.  **Subtract $2x$ from both sides** (Balance the variable term):
    $$5 = 10$$
2.  **Analyze:** Since $5$ is *not* equal to $10$, this equation is a **contradiction**. No value of $x$ will ever make it true.
3.  **Conclusion:** The equation has **No Solution**.

#### B. Infinite Solutions (Identity)

This happens when you arrive at a true statement.

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{3(x + 1) = 3x + 3}$

1.  **Distribute:**
    $$3x + 3 = 3x + 3$$
2.  **Subtract $3x$ from both sides:**
    $$3 = 3$$
3.  **Analyze:** Since $3$ is *always* equal to $3$, this equation is an **identity**. It is true for every possible value of $x$.
4.  **Conclusion:** The equation has **Infinite Solutions** (or "All Real Numbers").


### Solving equation
The goal is to isolate the variable (get x all by itself) on one side of the equation.
