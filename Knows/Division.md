# Division

## How much we need?

$$\frac{\text{What i want}}{\text{What i have}} = \text{Scaling Factor (or Multiplier)}$$


is used to determine a **scaling factor**, **percentage**, a **proportion**, or **unit conversion**.

If i have recepie to make 10 cookies, i need to make 30

$$\frac{30}{10} = 3$$

You have to triple the ingredients

### The Result

The result of the calculation can be interpreted as:

| If the result is... | It means... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You need **more** than you currently have. |
| **Less than 1** | You need **less** than you currently have (e.g., you are scaling down). |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |



## How much we have?

$$\frac{\text{What i have}}{\text{What i want}} = \text{Proportion (or Percentage Complete)}$$

is an inverted ratio often used to calculate a proportion of completeness, a fraction of a goal achieved, or a scaling factor for reduction.



$$\frac{10}{30} = 0.3$$

here 100% is 30, you are 30% of your goal

### The Result

| If the result is... | It means... (How much part you have) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You have excess of what you want |
| **Less than 1** |  you don't have desire amount |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |
