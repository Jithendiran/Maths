## Rates and Ratios

### What is Ratio?

A ratio is a comparison between two or more quantities of the same unit.

#### How much we need?

$$\frac{\text{What i want}}{\text{What i have}} = \text{Scaling Factor (or Multiplier)}$$


is used to determine a **scaling factor**, **percentage**, a **proportion**, or **unit conversion**.

If i have recepie to make 10 cookies, i need to make 30

$$\frac{30}{10} = 3$$

You have to triple the ingredients

##### The Result

The result of the calculation can be interpreted as:

| If the result is... | It means... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You need **more** than you currently have. |
| **Less than 1** | You need **less** than you currently have (e.g., you are scaling down). |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |


#### How much we have?

$$\frac{\text{What i have}}{\text{What i want}} = \text{Proportion (or Percentage Complete)}$$

is an inverted ratio often used to calculate a proportion of completeness, a fraction of a goal achieved, or a scaling factor for reduction.



$$\frac{10}{30} = 0.3$$

here 100% is 30, you are 30% of your goal

##### The Result

| If the result is... | It means... (How much part you have) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You have excess of what you want |
| **Less than 1** |  you don't have desire amount |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |

#### Ratio exaples
1. **Screen size is 2560 x 1440, i have image of 1920 x 1080**

    For simplicity just calculate 2560/1920, eliminating 1440/1080

    1. 
        $$\frac{2560 \text{ need}}{1920 \text{ have}} = 1.33 \text{ need per have}$$
        Each pixel in 1920 has to cover 1.33 pixels of 2560 screen (Scale Factor)
    
    2. 
        $$\frac{1920 \text{ have}}{2560 \text{ need}} = 0.75 \text{ have per need}$$
        Each pixel in 2560 will show 75% of one pixel in 1920 (Proportion of Source per Screen Pixel)


**Generalize**

Dimensionless comparison that expresses How much the size of one quantity relative to another.

$$\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quantity A}}{\text{Quantity B}} \implies \text{The proportion of A compared to B.}$$

### What is Rate?
A rate is a comparison between two quantities that have different units. Rates are used to measure how much of one quantity exists or changes for every unit of another quantity

**Per** means **Divide by or /**

#### Rate examples
1. **Car travelled 120 Km in 60 min**

    1. 
        $$\frac{120\text{ Km}}{60 \text{ min}} = 2\text{ Km per min}$$
        What we found is kilometer covered for 1 min

    2. 
        $$\frac{60 \text{ min}}{120 \text{ Km}} = \frac{1}{2}=0.5 \text{ min per Km}$$
        What we found is minutes required to cover 1 km


2. **Total 10 child, apple is sliced into 5 pieces, per child $\frac{4}{5}$ pieces**

    $$\frac{\text{Children }}{\frac{Pieces}{apple}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 
    \text{ Children per piece per apple}$$

**Generalize**

how much of the first quantity corresponds to one unit of the second quantity.
$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Quantity A}}{\text{Quantity B}} \implies \text{The amount of Quantity A per single unit of Quantity B.}$$
