## Rates and Ratios

### What is Ratio?

A ratio is a comparison between two or more quantities of the same unit.

#### How much we need?

$$\frac{\text{What i want}}{\text{What i have}} = \text{Scaling Factor (or Multiplier)}$$


is used to determine a **scaling factor**, **percentage**, a **proportion**, or **unit conversion**.

If i have recepie to make 10 cookies, i need to make 30

$$\frac{30}{10} = 3$$

You have to triple the ingredients

##### The Result

The result of the calculation can be interpreted as:

| If the result is... | It means... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You need **more** than you currently have. |
| **Less than 1** | You need **less** than you currently have (e.g., you are scaling down). |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |


#### How much we have?

$$\frac{\text{What i have}}{\text{What i want}} = \text{Proportion (or Percentage Complete)}$$

is an inverted ratio often used to calculate a proportion of completeness, a fraction of a goal achieved, or a scaling factor for reduction.



$$\frac{10}{30} = 0.3$$

here 100% is 30, you are 30% of your goal

##### The Result

| If the result is... | It means... (How much part you have) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Greater than 1** | You have excess of what you want |
| **Less than 1** |  you don't have desire amount |
| **Equal to 1** | You have exactly what you need. |

#### Ratio exaples
1. **Screen size is 2560 x 1440, i have image of 1920 x 1080**

    For simplicity just calculate 2560/1920, eliminating 1440/1080

    1. 
        $$\frac{2560 \text{ need}}{1920 \text{ have}} = 1.33 \text{ need per have}$$
        Each pixel in 1920 has to cover 1.33 pixels of 2560 screen (Scale Factor)
    
    2. 
        $$\frac{1920 \text{ have}}{2560 \text{ need}} = 0.75 \text{ have per need}$$
        Each pixel in 2560 will show 75% of one pixel in 1920 (Proportion of Source per Screen Pixel)


**Generalize**

Dimensionless comparison that expresses How much the size of one quantity relative to another.

$$\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quantity A}}{\text{Quantity B}} \implies \text{The proportion of A compared to B.}$$

---

### What is Rate?
A rate is a comparison between two quantities that have different units. Rates are used to measure how much of one quantity exists or changes for every unit of another quantity

**Per** means **Divide by or /**

#### Rate examples
1. **Car travelled 120 Km in 60 min**

    1. 
        $$\frac{120\text{ Km}}{60 \text{ min}} = 2\text{ Km per min}$$
        What we found is kilometer covered for 1 min  
        This is called as **speed**

    2. 
        $$\frac{60 \text{ min}}{120 \text{ Km}} = \frac{1}{2}=0.5 \text{ min per Km}$$
        What we found is minutes required to cover 1 km  
        This is called as **Pace**


2. **Total 10 child, apple is sliced into 5 pieces, per child $\frac{4}{5}$ pieces**

    $$\frac{\text{Children }}{\frac{Pieces}{apple}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 
    \text{ Children per piece per apple}$$

**Generalize**

how much of the first quantity corresponds to one unit of the second quantity.
$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Quantity A}}{\text{Quantity B}} \implies \text{The amount of Quantity A per single unit of Quantity B.}$$

#### Rate of change

**A Car travelled 360Km on 6 hours**

Lets take time 6 hours as $x$ and distance 360Km as $y$

* If we want to find the ditance $(y)$ covered for any amount of time $(x)$, we have to find the **Constant Rate of $y$ with respect to single unit of $x$**

    $$\frac{\text{$y$}}{\text{$x$}} = \text{Constant rate of $y$ for single unit of $x$}$$

    $$\frac{360 \text{ Km}}{6 \text{ Hours}} = 60 \frac{\text{Km}}{\text{Hour}} \text{or Km per Hour}$$

    The finding is for every 1 hour **(Single unit of x)**, car travelled 60 Km **(Constant Rate of y)**

    If we want to find for 2 hours or 0.5 hours substitute like this
    
    60 is always constant here

    $$\text{Constant Rate of y} \times \text{Change of x} = \text{Change of y}$$

    $$60 \times 0.5 = 30\text{ Km}$$
    $$60 \times 1 = 60\text{ Km}$$
    $$60 \times 2 = 120\text{ Km}$$

    speed **AKA** Rate of Distance ($y$) with respect to Time ($x$)


* If we want to find the time $(x)$ taken to cover any amount of distance $(y)$, we have to find the **Constant Rate of $x$ with respect to single unit of $y$**

    $$\frac{\text{$x$}}{\text{$y$}} = \text{Constant rate of $x$ for single unit of $y$}$$

    $$\frac{6 \text{ Hours}}{360 \text{ Km}} = 0.016666667 \frac{\text{ Hour}}{\text{ Km}} \text{or Hours per Km}$$

    This finding is for every 1 KM **(Single unit of y)**, time taken is 0.016666667 Hours or $0.016666667\text{ hours }\times 60\text{ min/hour} = 1\text{ min}$

    if we want to find for 2 Km or 0.5 Km  substitute like this

    $0.016666667\text{ hours }$ or $1 \text{ min}$ is always constant here

    $$\text{Constant Rate of x} \times \text{Change of y} = \text{Change of x}$$
    $$0.016666667 \times 0.5 = 0.008333334\text{ Hour} \text{ or } 1 \times 0.5 = 0.5 \text{ min} $$
    $$0.016666667 \times 2 = 0.033333334\text{ Hours} \text{ or } 1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ min}$$
    $$0.016666667 \times 60 = 1\text{ Hour} \text{ or } 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ min} $$

    Pace **AKA** Rate of Time ($x$) with respect to Distance ($y$)
