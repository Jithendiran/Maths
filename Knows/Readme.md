## GCD vs LCM

### GCD
The Goal is Reduction (Simplification)

You have two numbers, and you want to make them both smaller by dividing them by the largest possible shared number. You are finding the largest shared building block that goes into both numbers.

GCD is for making things smaller or simpler.

You need to find the smaller or simpler equivalent because it makes the math easier to read, understand, and use in the real world.

Complex Way (Unsimplified): "I ate twelve thirty-sixths of the pizza." ( 12/36 )
Simple Way (Simplified with GCD): "I ate one-third of the pizza." ( 1/3 )



### LCM
The Goal is Buildup (Find a Meeting Point)

You have two numbers, and you want to find the smallest number that is big enough for both of them to multiply up to. You are finding the smallest number that contains both numbers perfectly.

Bus A comes every 8 minutes. Bus B comes every 12 minutes. If they just arrived together, when will they arrive together again? Action: Find the smallest time that is a multiple of both 8 and 12.
LCM(8,12)=24. They will arrive together again in 24 minutes.

BUS A: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ....
BUS B: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, .....

Common: 24, 48, ...

every 24th minute we can see both Bus a and Bus b

LCM is for making things equivalent or finding when they line up.

When you are combining fractions (using the LCM to find the common denominator), you are looking for the smallest possible common size to work with.

Why not use any common denominator? Why choose 12 for 1/4+1/6 instead of 24 or 48?

* Using the LCM (12):
$$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$$
* Using a larger common multiple (24):
$$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{24} + \frac{4}{24} = \frac{10}{24}$$

Notice that with the larger number (24), you ended up with a fraction (10/24)  that you now have to simplify anyway to get to (5/12)


## What is an Exponent?

An exponent is the small number written just above and to the right of another number or variable.

In the expression $\mathbf{b^n}$:

* **b** is the **Base**: The number or variable being multiplied.
* **n** is the **Exponent**: The number of times the base is multiplied by itself.

$$\text{Base}^{\text{Exponent}} = \underbrace{\text{Base} \times \text{Base} \times \dots \times \text{Base}}_{\text{n times}}$$

### Simple Examples

| Expression | Meaning (Expanded Form) | Value | What it's Doing |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| $\mathbf{3^2}$ | $3 \times 3$ | 9 | Multiplying the base (3) by itself 2 times. |
| $\mathbf{2^4}$ | $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$ | 16 | Multiplying the base (2) by itself 4 times. |
| $\mathbf{x^3}$ | $x \times x \times x$ | - | Multiplying the variable $x$ by itself 3 times. |
