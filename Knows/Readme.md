## GCD vs LCM

### GCD
The Goal is Reduction (Simplification)

You have two numbers, and you want to make them both smaller by dividing them by the largest possible shared number. You are finding the largest shared building block that goes into both numbers.

GCD is for making things smaller or simpler.

You need to find the smaller or simpler equivalent because it makes the math easier to read, understand, and use in the real world.

Complex Way (Unsimplified): "I ate twelve thirty-sixths of the pizza." ( 12/36 )
Simple Way (Simplified with GCD): "I ate one-third of the pizza." ( 1/3 )



### LCM
The Goal is Buildup (Find a Meeting Point)

You have two numbers, and you want to find the smallest number that is big enough for both of them to multiply up to. You are finding the smallest number that contains both numbers perfectly.

Bus A comes every 8 minutes. Bus B comes every 12 minutes. If they just arrived together, when will they arrive together again? Action: Find the smallest time that is a multiple of both 8 and 12.
LCM(8,12)=24. They will arrive together again in 24 minutes.

BUS A: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ....
BUS B: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, .....

Common: 24, 48, ...

every 24th minute we can see both Bus a and Bus b

LCM is for making things equivalent or finding when they line up.

When you are combining fractions (using the LCM to find the common denominator), you are looking for the smallest possible common size to work with.

Why not use any common denominator? Why choose 12 for 1/4+1/6 instead of 24 or 48?

* Using the LCM (12):
$$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$$
* Using a larger common multiple (24):
$$\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{24} + \frac{4}{24} = \frac{10}{24}$$

Notice that with the larger number (24), you ended up with a fraction (10/24)  that you now have to simplify anyway to get to (5/12)

## Algebric inversion 
why moving in other side of the equation we are changeing multiply to divide, divide to multiply?

We don't actually "move" the term; we perform the inverse operation on both sides of the equation to cancel the term on one side.

Let's look at an example to see why multiplication changes to division:
#### Find the price of one pen if 5 pens cost $20.

$$5 \times x = 20$$

$$5 \rarr \text{Number of pens}$$
$$x \rarr \text{Cost of 1 pen}$$
$$20 \rarr \text{Cost of 20 pens}$$

The goal of solving an equation is to isolate the variable (x) on one side of the equals sign. To achieve this, you must cancel out all other terms affecting x by performing the inverse operation. To maintain the equality of the equation, every operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other.

We want to get x by itself. Since x is being multiplied by 5, the only way to cancel the "×5" is by dividing by 5.

1. Divide both side by 5:

$$\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{20}{5}$$

2. The 5s on the left cancel out (because 5÷5=1, and 1×x=x):

$$x=\frac{20}{5}$$

3. $$x = 4$$


The Core Rule: Why We Must Do It on Both Sides

The equals sign (=) in an equation means that the expression on the left side has the exact same value as the expression on the right side.

* If you change the weight on one side of a balanced scale (e.g., you divide the weight on the left by 5), the scale will tip and be unbalanced.

* To keep the scale perfectly balanced (i.e., to keep the equation true), you must perform the exact same change (divide the weight on the right by 5) to the other side.

### Other rules

1. $x + 7 = 15$  
x is combined with +7, to eliminate we have to do $-7$ in both side

$$x + 7 -7 = 15 - 7 $$
$$x = 15 - 7 = 8$$

2. $x - 7 = 15$  
x is combined with -7, to eliminate we have to do $+7$ in both side

$$x - 7 + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22$$

3. $\frac{x}{5} = 15$

x is on divide, to cancel out $\frac{}{5}$ we have to do $\times 5 $ on both side

$$ \frac{x}{5}  \times 5= 15 \times 5$$
$$x = 15 \times 5 = 75$$
