$$\frac{a \text{(unit 1)}}{b \text{(unit 2)}} = \text{Ratio or Rate of unit}\frac{unit1}{unit2}$$

The resulting unit tells you "how much of unit 1 corresponds to each unit of unit 2."

**Example**

| Calculation | Units | Resulting Concept | Compound Unit (Rate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}$ | $\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ or $\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$ | **Speed**: $\text{Miles per hour or meter per second}$ | $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}$ |
| $\frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Quantity}}$ | $\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{gallon}}$ or $\frac{\text{euros}}{\text{kilogram}}$ | **Unit Price**: $\text{Dollars per gallon or euros per kilogram}$ | $\frac{\text{Currency}}{\text{Mass/Volume}}$ |
| $\frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$ | $\frac{\text{kilograms}}{\text{cubic meter}}$ | **Density**:  $\text{Kilo per cubic meter}$ | $\frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$ |


Car traveled 150 kilo meter, 2 hours

$$\frac{150 Kilo meter}{2 hours} = 75\text{ Km per hour} == 75 \text{KM / hr}$$

For 1 hour i travelled 75 kilometer

To verify : $$75 \text{ Km / Hr} \times 2 \text{ Hr}= 150\text{ Km}$$

For 2 hours i travelled 150 Km

Ratio: $75:1$ Km to hr

$$\frac{150 Kilo meter}{120 minutes} = 1.25\text{ Kilo meter per minutes }== 1.25 \text{ Km/ min}$$

$$1.25 \text{ Km/ min} \times 120 \text{ min} = 150 \text{ Km}$$

Ratio: $1.25:1$ Km to min

Here division is finding the Unit of distance travel based on the denominator (Hours or Minutes)

# Question:


**I need to figure out how many apples to buy to feed 10 children. I'm going to cut every apple into 5 equal slices. Each child should get 4 of those slices**

10 is the number of children

4 Pieces for each child

5 Pieces per whole object

Each child can have $\frac{4}{5}$ apple, for 10 children it is $10 \times \frac{4}{5}$

### Different Paths to the Same Destination

$$10 \rarr \text{Total child}$$
$$5 \rarr \text{One whole object splitted pieces}$$
$$4 \rarr \text{Pieces for each child}$$

i believe even all give the same result, intuation for each path is different 

i'm trying to find the idea for each path


#### Method 1: Repeated addition

Each child can have $\frac{4}{5}$, total 10 children 

$$=\frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5}$$

Since all are identical object we can do the fraction addition

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\frac{\text{{Pieces}}}{\text{Apple}}} = \frac{Total \cancel{\text{ pieces}}}{\cancel{\text{Pieces}}} \times \text{Apples} = \text{Total Apple}$$
$$=\frac{40}{5} = 8$$

Total i need 8 apples

#### Method 2: Scale Up then Scale down

Children count 10, each child can have 4 pieces so
$$\text{Total child} \times \text{Pieces for each child} = \text{Total pieces}$$
$$10 \times 4 = 40$$

Total i need 40 pieces, now we have to know how many apples we need

Each apple can cut or slice into 5 pieces

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}} = \text{Total whole object}$$

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\frac{\text{{Pieces}}}{\text{Apple}}} = \frac{Total \cancel{\text{ pieces}}}{\cancel{\text{Pieces}}} \times \text{Apples} = \text{Total Apple}$$

$$\frac{40}{5}=8$$

In this method we 1st calculate total pieces needed (scale up), then finding how many total object needed

1. **Scale Up to Total Pieces** : Ignore the splitting for a moment and just find the total number of small units (pieces) required from all children combined. 10 children×4 pieces/child=40 pieces.
2. **Scale Down to Total Objects** : Now, group those total required pieces into the size of a whole object (apples).

#### Method 3: Unit calculate and scale UP

$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}}=\text{Total whole object for 1 piece}$$

This step calculates the number of apples required if you were only giving 1 piece to each of the 10 children.

---
$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\frac{Pieces}{apple}} = \frac{\text{Total Child}}{\text{Pieces}} \times \text{apple} = \text{Childs per apple pieces}$$


$$\frac{10}{5}=2$$

One piece of apple is shared between 2 child

----

$$\text{Total whole object for 1 piece} \times \text{Actual needed Pieces for each child} = \text{Total whole object}$$

$$2 \times 4 = 8$$

If each child took 1 piece we need 2 apples, if each child took 4 pieces we need 8 apple

In this method we 1st calculate for base count for single unit, then scale up to no of actual pieces

1. **Unit Calculation** : Calculate the number of whole objects (apples) needed if you were only giving 1 piece to each of the 10 children. This is the Resource Density—the total objects required per single piece for all children.  

2. **Scale Up**: Since each child actually needs 4 pieces, multiply the "1-piece-per-child" apple count by 4. 2×4 pieces=8 apples.

#### Method 4: Percentage / Decimal

$$\frac{\text{Pieces for each child}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}} = \text{Percentage of one whole object for each cild}$$

$$\frac{4}{5}=0.8$$

$$\text{Total child} \times \text{Percentage of one whole object for each child} = \text{Total whole Object}$$

$$10 \times 0.8 = 8$$

1.  **Calculate the Factor**: Determine what fraction (or decimal/percentage) of one apple is needed per child.  $\frac{5}{4}=0.8$.

2. **Multiply by Total Unit**: Multiply the total number of children by the apple factor. $10 \times 0.8 = 8$

Question:

**8 Whole Apples, 4 Pieces per child, 5 pieces per apple, total child can fed?**

#### Method 1

$$\text{Whole Apples} \times \text{Pieces per apple} = \text{Total pieces}$$

$$8 \times 5 = 40$$

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Pieces per person}} =\text{ Total person}$$

$$\frac{40}{4} = 10$$

#### Method 2

$$\frac{\text{Pieces per person}}{\text{Pieces per apple}} = \text{Per person whole apple}$$

$$\frac{4}{5} \text{ in fraction}$$

$$\frac{\text{ Total whole apple}}{\frac{\text{Pieces per person}}{\text{Pieces per apple}}} = \text{Total person}$$

$$\frac{8}{\frac{4}{5}} = 10$$

If we devide $\frac{4}{5}$ of 8 apples we can feed 10 person

#### Method 3

>[!WARNING]  
> This method may confuse

$$\frac{\text{Total Apples}}{\text{Pieces per person}} = \text{Total person can feed for 1 piece}$$
Consider each apple is splitted into 1 piece so, 1 apple = 1 piece, 8 apple = 8 piece

$$\frac{8 \text{ piece of apple}}{4 \text{ piece per person}} = 2 \text{ Person can feed}$$

I have enough apples to feed 2 person

$$\text{Total person can feed for 1 piece} \times \text{Pieces per apple} =\text{ Total person}$$
$$2 \times 1 = 2$$
If slices per apple increase, people can feed also increase

It means that the total supply of 8 apple-pieces could only feed 2 people if the apples were not cut into smaller pieces (i.e., 1 apple = 1 piece). In other words, the total resource is 2 times the consumption rate.
$$2 \times 2 = 4\text{ person}$$

$$2 \times 3 = 6\text{ person}$$

$$\vdots$$

$$2 \times 5 = 10\text{ person}$$

**General Formula**

$$\frac{\text{Total resource}}{\text{Usage rate per unit}} = \text{Efficiency Factor}$$
Efficiency Factor = The Total potential groups or units that can be served before considering any division or slicing of the resource.


$$\text{Efficiency Factor} \times \text{Parts per resource} = \text{Total capacity}$$

Question:

**5 pieces per apple, total 8 apple, 10 child, no.of.slices per apple**


#### Method 1

$$\text{Pieces per apple} \times \text{Total apple} = \text{Total pieces}$$
$$5 \times 8 = 40$$

$$\frac{\text{Total Pieces}}{\text{Total child}} = \text{Pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{40}{10} = 4$$

#### Method 2

$$\frac{\text{Total apple}}{\text{Total child}} = \text{Apple per child }$$

$$\frac{8}{10}= 0.8$$

$$\text{Apple per child} \times \text{Slice per apple} = \text{Total slice per child}$$

$$0.8 \times 5 = 4$$

#### Method 3

$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\text{Piece per apple}} = \text{Apples pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{10}{5} = 2$$

You have 2 children for every 1 slice a single apple provides

It's a ratio comparing the "demand" (children) to the "supply unit" (slices from one apple).



$$\frac{\text{Total Apple}}{\text{Apples pieces per child}} = \text{pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{8}{2}=4$$


----

Question:

**8 apples, 4 piece for each child and 10 child, no.of.slices per apple**


#### Method 1

$$\text{Pieces per child} \times \text{Total child} = \text{Total Pieces}$$

$$\frac{Pieces}{\cancel{Child}} \times \text{Total } \cancel{\text{child}} = \text{Pieces total}$$

$$4 \times 10 = 40$$

$$\frac{\text{Total Pieces}}{\text{Total apple}} = \text{Pieces per apple}$$

$$\frac{40}{8} = 5\text{ pieces per apple}$$

---
#### Method 2

**Doubt**

$$\frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Pieces per child}} =\text{ Apple Pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{8}{4} = 2$$

$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\text{Apples per child}} = \text{Slices per apple}$$

$$\frac{10}{2} = 5$$

----

#### Method 3
$$\frac{\text{Pieces per child}}{\text{Total apple}} = \text{Apple pieces per child}$$
$$\text{Apple pieces per child} \times \text{Total child} = \text{Pieces per apple}$$
$$ = \frac{4}{8} \times 10$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \times 10$$
$$= \frac{10}{2} = 5$$

# Generalize

* $C$: Total number of **Children**
* $A$: Total number of **Apples**
* $P$: **Pieces** of apple each child gets
* $S$: **Slices** (or pieces) an apple is cut into (Slices per Apple)

----

The total number of pieces available is $A \times S$. 

$$8 \text{ Apples}\times 5 \frac{\text{Pieces}}{\text{Apple}} = 40 \text{ Pieces}$$

$$8 \cancel{\text{ Apples}}\times 5 \frac{\text{Pieces}}{\cancel{\text{Apple}}} = 40 \text{ Pieces}$$

The total number of pieces distributed is $C \times P$.   

$$10 \text{ Child} \times 4 \frac{\text{Pieces}}{\text{Child}} = 40 \text{ Pieces}$$

$$10 \cancel{\text{ Child}} \times 4 \frac{\text{Pieces}}{\cancel{\text{Child}}} = 40 \text{ Pieces}$$

Since the total pieces available must equal the total pieces distributed, the fundamental equation is:
$$\mathbf{A \times S = C \times P}$$

-----

Child per apple pieces

$$\frac{10 \text{ Child}}{5 \text{Pieces per apple}} \rarr \frac{\text{Child}}{\frac{Pieces}{apple}} = 2$$

$$\frac{8 \text{Apple}}{4 \text{Pieces per child}} \rarr \frac{\text{Apple}}{\frac{Pieces}{Child}} = 2$$

$$\mathbf{\frac{C}{S} = \frac{A}{P}}$$
