# Chapter 1: Understanding Numbers 

## Introduction

### What numbers really are and why they exist

**Have you ever wondered...**

* Why do we need numbers at all?
* What did people do before numbers were invented?
* Why are there different types of numbers?
* How did ancient people count without our number system?

**Imagine a world without numbers...**  
Picture this: You wake up and want to meet your friend. How would you tell them the time? You can't say "3 o'clock" because numbers don't exist!  

You go to buy bread. How would you ask for "2 loaves" or pay with "5 coins"?  

You want to share pizza with friends. How would you divide it fairly without knowing "half" or "quarter"?  

**This is exactly the world our ancestors lived in thousands of years ago!**

### The Birth of Numbers: A Human Story

**Step 1: The Counting Problem**  

Long ago, shepherds had a problem. They needed to know if all their sheep came back home. But they didn't have numbers!

Their solution? They used one-to-one matching:

* For each sheep going out, they put one stone in a bag
* When sheep returned, they took out one stone for each sheep
* If stones were left in the bag, some sheep were missing!

This was the birth of **counting** - the very first use of numbers.

**Step 2: The Growing Problem**  

As civilizations grew, people needed to count bigger things:
* How many bags of grain do we have?
* How many days until the next full moon?
* How many soldiers are in our army?

Stones became impractical. People started using:
* Tally marks (||||)
* Body parts (fingers, toes)
* Words for quantities

**Step 3: The Writing Problem**  
Eventually, people needed to write down these quantities. Different civilizations created different systems:

* Egyptians: Used hieroglyphs
* Romans: Used letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M)
* Arabs/Indians: Created the system we use today (1, 2, 3, 4...)



### Why Numbers Are Everywhere

Numbers aren't just mathematical tools - they're the language of the universe:

**In Daily Life**

**Time**: "I'll meet you in 15 minutes"  
**Money**: "This costs $10"  
**Cooking**: "Add 2 cups of flour"  
**Sports**: "The score is 3-2"  

**In Nature**

**Flower petals**: Most flowers have 3, 5, or 8 petals  
**Bee hexagons**: Perfect 6-sided shapes  
**Spiral shells**: Follow mathematical patterns  
**Human body**: 2 eyes, 10 fingers, 32 teeth  

**In Technology**

**Computers**: Everything is 0s and 1s  
**Music**: Notes follow mathematical ratios  
**Architecture**: Buildings use geometric proportions  
**Internet**: Every website has a numerical address  

### Fun Facts to Get You Started
**The Number Zero**

Zero was invented around 628 AD in India
Romans had no symbol for zero - they just left blank spaces!
Zero is neither positive nor negative

**The Number Pi (π)**

Has been calculated to over 50 trillion decimal places
Appears in circles, but also in probability and statistics
Its decimal expansion never repeats or ends

**Negative Numbers**

Chinese mathematicians used red and black rods for positive and negative
European mathematicians rejected negative numbers for centuries
They're essential for modern science and technology

**The Golden Ratio**

Found in flower petals, spiral shells, and human faces
Artists use it to create pleasing proportions
It's an irrational number: 1.618033988...

## What is number system

### Let's Think About It
Point to a "3" in your room.Can you do it?  

You might point to:
* The number "3" written on a clock
* 3 books on a shelf
* 3 fingers on your hand  

But here's the fascinating part: **The number "3" itself doesn't exist as a physical thing!**

A number is a mental concept that describes a physical object
* **Quantity**: How many things there are
    
    3 apples, 7 days, 24 hours,..
* **Value**: How much something is worth

    200 Rupees, 2 Dollar,..
* **Position**: Where something is in a sequence

    1st position, your birthday is on 15th
* **Relationship**: How things compare to each other

    Price of this product is 20% cheaper that other,..

The mathematical idea that exists in our minds. This is the same for all humans, regardless of language or culture.

----

A **number system** is the *language* we use to write down the idea of a number. It's a set of symbols and rules for representing numbers.

Just as we have different languages to describe the same animal (dog, chien, perro), we have different number systems to write down the same quantity.

A number system always has two main parts:
1.  **Digits:** The set of symbols it uses (e.g., `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`).
2.  **Rules:** A rule for how to combine those symbols, which is usually **place value** based on a "base" (like base-10 or base-2).

**Examples of writing the number "five":**
*   **Decimal (Base-10) System:** We write **`5`**.
*   **Binary (Base-2) System:** A computer writes **`101`** (meaning 1 four + 0 twos + 1 one).
*   **Roman Numeral System:** An ancient Roman would write **`V`**.
*   **Unary (Tally) System:** A person keeping score would write **`|||||`**.

All four of those representations—`5`, `101`, `V`, and `|||||`—are different ways of writing the same single idea: the number five.

In short: **A number is *what* you are counting, and a number system is *how* you write it down.**  

We needed to invent these systems because just using tally marks (|||||||||||||...) gets very messy and hard to read for large numbers.

### The Problem: How to Count Without a Mess

Imagine you're an ancient shepherd counting your sheep with pebbles. You have 12 sheep. You have a pile of 12 pebbles. If you had 152 sheep, you'd have a giant, confusing pile of 152 pebbles.

You need a better way to organize them. This leads to the single most important idea in all number systems:

Instead of one giant pile, you decide on a rule: **"Every time I get a certain number of pebbles, I'll make a special new pile for that group."**

The size of that group is called the **base**. This one choice defines the entire number system.

The **Base** is the most important decision. It's the magic number you choose for grouping.

*   In our everyday **Base-10** system, we group things by **tens**.
*   In the **Base-2** system computers use, they group things by **twos**.

The base tells you when you've "run out of digits" and need to form a group.

### The Digits: The Symbols You Can Use

The digits are the set of symbols you have available to write with. The rule is simple:

> **In any Base 'B', the digits you can use are all the whole numbers from `0` up to `B-1`.**

> why we are using 0,1,2,.. because this is easy to understand, you can use any symbols 

*   **Base-10** (Decimal) uses digits `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.
*   **Base-2** (Binary) uses digits `0, 1`.
*   **Base-5** (Pentasystem) uses digits `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.

Having a `0` is crucial. It acts as a **placeholder** to show that a position is empty.

### The Engine - Place Value

Place value is the engine that makes number systems powerful. It's the rule that a digit's value changes depending on its position.

#### The Anchor: The Ones Place

The entire number system is built around the **Ones Place**. We can't build other numbers without one, so it is the fundamental of maths, we can build any numbers with 1.

It is the center of the number universe, the anchor that separates whole numbers from fractions.

*   It represents **one whole unit**.
*   It is the boundary between getting bigger (moving left) and getting smaller (moving right).

####  Moving Left (Whole Numbers): The Power of Multiplication

When we move left from the Ones Place, the value of each position increases. How? By **multiplying by the base** at every step.

Let's look at Base-2:

| Place Name         | How We Got It | Value | 
| :----------------- | :------------ | :---- |
| **Ones (Anchor)**  | (Start)       | 1     |
| **Two's**          | `1 x 2`       | 2     |
| **four's**         | `2 x 2`       | 4     |
| **eight's**        | `4 x 2`       | 8     |

This multiplicative growth is essential.

#### Moving Right (Fractions): The Power of Division

When we move right from the Ones Place, the value of each position decreases. How? By **dividing by the base** at every step.

Let's look at Base-2 again:

| Place Name         | How We Got It | Value   |
| :----------------- | :------------ | :------ |
| **Ones (Anchor)**  | (Start)       | 1       |
| **Two's**          | `1 ÷ 2`       | 1/2     |
| **four's**         | `(1/2) ÷ 2`   | 1/4     |
| **eight's**        | `(1/4) ÷ 2`   | 1/8     |

Notice the beautiful symmetry around the Ones Place.

### Why Multiplication? The "Perfect Lego Kit" Proof

Why must place values be multiplicative (`1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32..`) instead of additive (`1, 2, 3, 4...`) or mixed (`1, 2, 4, 6...`)?

Because a multiplicative system is the only way to create a "perfect kit" that follows two rules:
1.  **No Gaps:** You can build a representation for every possible number.
2.  **No Confusion:** There is only **one** unique way to represent each number.

#### *Let's Start Building Number system*

We have only 2 symbols to indicate the number (0 and 1). Lets find the place value for base-2

0 is to incdicate no value or just an place holder

*Slot 1: The First Position*

*   We need to be able to write the number *One. We have no choice. Our first slot must be worth **1***.
*   *Our System So Far:* We have a *[1s place]*.
*   *Numbers we can write:* 0 and 1.
*   *Problem:* We can't write the number *Two*. We have run of of symbold, We have a gap.

*Slot 2: The Second Position*

*   We need to add a new, second slot to solve our problem. What should its value be? Let's call it X.
*   *Our System So Far:* We have a *[Xs place]* and a *[1s place]*.
*   The value X must be chosen perfectly to obey our two rules.

Let's test the options for X:

*   *Could X be 1?*
    *   Our slots would be [1s place] and another [1s place].
    *   How could we write the number *Two*? By putting a 1 in both slots. Okay. 
        ```
                1       1   (Numbers)
               ------------- 
                1       1    (Place value)     
        ```
    *   How could we write the number *One*? We could put a 1 in the first slot OR in the second slot.
        ```
                0       1   (Numbers)
               ------------- 
                1       1    (Place value)
      
        or
               
                1       0   (Numbers)
               ------------- 
                1       1    (Place value)
        ```
    *   *FAILURE.* This breaks the "No Confusion Rule." There are two ways to write the number One.

*   *Could X be 3?*
    *   Our slots would be [3s place] and [1s place].       
        ```
        ----------------------
                3       1
        ```
    *   We can write *One* (01), *Three* (10), and *Four* (11).
        ```
           

        1->     0   1
                -----
                3   1

        3->     1   0
                ------
                3   1
        
        4 ->   1    1
               -------
               3    1
         
        2 -> impossible
        ```
    *   *FAILURE.* We can't write the number *Two*. This breaks the "No Gaps Rule."

*   *The only choice that works is X = 2.*
    *   Our slots are [2s place] and [1s place].
    *   Let's check:
        *   *One:* 01 (0 twos, 1 one) -> Only one way.
            ```
            1->     0   1
                --------------
                    2   1
            ```
        *   *Two:* 10 (1 two, 0 ones) -> Only one way.
            ```
            2->     1   0
                --------------
                    2   1
            ```
        *   *Three:* 11 (1 two, 1 one) -> Only one way.
            ```
            3->     1   1
                --------------
                    2   1
            ```
    *   *SUCCESS!* This choice follows both rules.

*So far, the values of our slots must be 2 and 1.*

*Slot 3: The Third Position*

*   *Our System So Far:* We have a [2s place] and a [1s place].
*   *The highest number we can write is Three* (11).
*   *Problem:* We can't write the number *Four*. We have a gap.

*   We need to add a new, third slot. What should its value be? Let's call it Y.
*   *Our System So Far:* We have a *[Ys place], a *[2s place]*, and a *[1s place]**.

Let's test the options for Y:

*   *Could Y be 3?*
    *   Our slots would be [3s place], [2s place], [1s place].
    *   How could we write the number *Three*? We could write 011 (a two and a one). OR we could write 100 (a three).
            ```
            3-> 0    1   1
                --------------
                3    2   1
            
            3-> 1    0   0
                --------------
                3    2   1
            ```
    *   *FAILURE.* This breaks the "No Confusion Rule." There are two ways to write Three.

*   *Could Y be 5?*
    *   Our slots would be [5s place], [2s place], [1s place].
    *   We can write *Three* (011). We can write *Five* (100).
            ```
            3-> 0    1   1
                --------------
                5    2   1
            
            3-> 1    0   0
                --------------
                5    2   1
            ```
    *   *FAILURE.* We can't write the number *Four*. This breaks the "No Gaps Rule."
            ```
            4-> (Impossible)
            ```

*   *The only choice that works is Y = 4.*
    *   Our slots are [4s place], [2s place], [1s place].
        ```
        ----------------------
            4    2       1
        ```
    *   This choice perfectly fills the gap. The highest we could make before was Three. The new slot lets us make *Four* (100) and continues up to *Seven* (111) with no gaps and no confusion.

        ```
        7-> 1   1    1
        ----------------------
            4    2   1
        ```
#### *The Deep, Fundamental Pattern We Discovered*

Look at the values of the slots we were forced to choose to obey the rules:

*1*
*2*
*4*
...and if we continued, the next one would have to be *8*.

We didn't pick these numbers. They were *forced upon us* by the two simple rules of "no gaps" and "no confusion."

This sequence (1, 2, 4, 8...) is generated by a deep underlying principle:

> *Each new place value must be exactly one greater than the sum of all the previous place values.*

*   The 2s place: 1 + 1 = 2.
*   The 4s place: (2 + 1) + 1 = 4.
*   The 8s place: (4 + 2 + 1) + 1 = 8.

It's a "doubling" pattern. They gave this pattern a shortcut name: *multiplication by 2*.

Numbers less than 1
--------------------

Lets say $\frac{3}{4}$.    

This means:

* 3 parts (numerator)
* Out of 4 equal parts (denominator)

But **3 cannot fully fit into 4** even once. So instead of whole groups, we need to break our unit into **smaller pieces**.

**Step 1: Zoom in using Base-10**

We use **base-10** system, which means:

* Each whole number is made of 10 smaller parts called **tenths (1/10)**
* Each tenth is made of 10 even smaller parts called **hundredths (1/100)**

Let’s imagine a number line from 0 to 3, zoomed into tenths:
```
0-|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-1.0-|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--|--2.0-|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--3.0
 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9   1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9   2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 

```

**Step 2: Represent 3 as 30 Tenths**

Since we can’t divide 3 into 4 equally at the whole number level, we **zoom in**:

* 3 ones = 30 tenths (because each 1 has 10 tenths)

Now divide **30 tenths** into **4 equal groups**:

| Group | Tenths in Group    |                          |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1     | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 |                          |
| 2     | 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 |                          |
| 3     | 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 |                          |
| 4     | 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 |                          |
| 5     | 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 |                          |
| 6     | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 |                          |
| 7     | 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 |                          |
| 8     | 2.9, 3.0           | ← **only 2 tenths left** |

So we have:

* 7 full groups of 4 tenths
* 2 tenths remaining

We zoom in further.

**Step 3: Zoom in Further – Tenths to Hundredths**  

Now break each tenth (like from 2.8 to 3.0) into **hundredths**:

```
2.80-|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----2.90--|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---3.00
    2.81  2.82  2.83  2.84  2.85  2.86  2.87  2.88  2.89       2.91  2.92  2.93  2.94  2.95  2.96  2.97  2.98  2.99 

```
We have **2 tenths = 20 hundredths**, now divide 20 into groups of 4:

| Group | Hundredths in Group    |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | 2.81, 2.82, 2.83, 2.84 |
| 2     | 2.85, 2.86, 2.87, 2.88 |
| 3     | 2.89, 2.90, 2.91, 2.92 |
| 4     | 2.93, 2.94, 2.95, 2.96 |
| 5     | 2.97, 2.98, 2.99, 3.00 |

So we get:

* 5 more full groups of hundredths (4 hundredths in each)

So it is 0.75

```
0 . 7    5 ...........
    |    |      |
1   1/10 1/100  1/1000.....
```

## Counting and Natural Numbers
Counting numbers are the numbers we use when we count things one by one.  
They start from 1 and go on

    Natural Numbers = Counting Numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …

**N** = {1, 2, 3, ...}

**Properties**  
* Always positive  
* Never ends

## Adding Zero - Whole Numbers

### Why Introduce Zero?
Imagine you have 5 pencils. Now, you give away all 5. How many do you have left?

You might say: "Nothing!". But how do we write "nothing" in math?

We use the number zero (0).

### What Are Whole Numbers?
Once zero was invented, mathematicians extended the set of natural numbers.

    Whole Numbers = Natural Numbers + Zero

**W** = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... }

**Properties**  
* It is neither positive nor negative.

## Going Below Zero - Integers

### Why below zero?
You have 3 apples. You give away 5 apples. How can you give more than you have?  
You're in debt — you owe 2 apples. But how do we write this in math? This is where negative numbers come in.

Negative numbers represent values less than zero.
They are used when something is missing, lost, owed, or below a baseline.

### What Are Integers?

    Integers = All positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers

**Z** = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }

| Question                                | Answer |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Is -2 less than 0?                      | Yes    |
| Is -5 less than -3?                     | Yes    |
| Is -1 greater than -5?                  | Yes    |
| Is 0 greater than all negative numbers? | Yes    |

## Parts of Numbers - Rational Numbers 

### What If a Number Isn't Whole?
Imagine you cut a cake into 4 equal pieces.
You eat 1 piece. How much of the cake did you eat?

Not a whole cake. Just a part.
We write this part as a fraction:
1/4 (one-fourth)
4/4 (means you have full cake which is splitted into 4 pieces)
5/4 (means you have one whole cake + 1 extra piece)

This kind of number — a part of a whole — is called a **rational number**.

### What Is a Rational Number?
A rational number is any number that can be written in the form: **a/b**

Where:
* a is an integer (positive, negative, or zero)
* b is a non-zero integer

| Expression | Value | Type                            |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| 1 / 2      | 0.5   | Proper fraction                 |
| 5 / 2      | 2.5   | Improper fraction               |
| 1 1/2      | 1.5   | Mixed number                    |
| -3 / 4     | -0.75 | Negative fraction               |
| 6 / 3      | 2     | Whole number                    |
| 0 / 5      | 0     | Zero (valid rational number)    |
| -10 / 1    | -10   | Negative integer                |
| 2.25       | 9 / 4 | Decimal form of rational number |


Any terminating or repeating decimal is a rational number.
* 0.75 = 3/4 (terminating)
* 0.333… = 1/3 (repeating)

Every integer, finite decimal, or repeating decimal is rational.

## Numbers We Can't Write Simply - Irrational Numbers

### What If a Number Never Ends and Never Repeats?
You’ve seen that rational numbers can be written as fractions like 1/2 or 3/4.
Even repeating decimals like 0.333… (which is 1/3) are rational.  

But what about numbers like:
* √2 = 1.4142135...
* π = 3.14159265...

These numbers:
* Never end
* Never repeat
* **Cannot be written as a fraction a/b**

### Why Are Irrational Numbers Important?
Even though you can’t write them exactly as fractions, irrational numbers are everywhere:

* Circles (π)
* Right triangles (√2, √3)
* Sound waves and signals
* Natural proportions
* Computer algorithms (approximate them)

Example

1. Let’s say you draw a square.  
    Each side is 1 unit long.  
    Now draw a line from one corner to the opposite corner — a diagonal.  
    How long is that line?  

    You might guess:  
    “Maybe 1.5?” or “Maybe 2?”  
    But actually, it’s about 1.414…  
    That’s √2 again — an irrational number.  

2. Do you know what π (pi) is?
    It’s the number we use to:  
    * Find how long around a circle is  
    * Find the area inside a circle  

Imagine a number line:

    0---1---2

Between 1 and 2, we already have: {1.1, 1.2, 1.3...} or {3/4, 7/8, 5/6...} But there are still tiny holes — values that are not fractions, not decimals, and not repeating.

Irrational numbers fill those holes so the line is fully complete.

    We need irrational numbers because some real things in life — like square roots and circles — can't be explained using only normal numbers or fractions.

## The Complete Picture - Real Numbers
Numbers are classified as 5 types
1. Natural {1,2,3,...}
2. Whole   {0,1,2,3,..}
3. Integers {-infinity,...,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... +infinity}
4. Rational {5/2, 0.63, 0.012} which ever numbers can be written as p/q, where q not equal to 0
5. Irrational {sqrt(3), pi, 0.101001...} The numbers which are not rational and cannot be written in the form of p/q

## How We Write Numbers - Place Value System

| Place         | Value       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Crores        | 1,00,00,000 |
| Ten Lakhs     | 10,00,000   |
| Lakhs         | 1,00,000    |
| Ten Thousands | 10,000      |
| Thousands     | 1,000       |
| Hundreds      | 100         |
| Tens          | 10          |
| Ones          | 1           |

1. the number 73,42,615 means:

    1. 7 ten lakhs = 70,00,000
    2. 3 lakhs = 3,00,000
    3. 4 ten thousands = 40,000
    4. 2 thousands = 2,000
    5. 6 hundreds = 600
    6. 1 ten = 10
    7. 5 ones = 5

    Add it all:
    `73,42,615 = 70,00,000 + 3,00,000 + 40,000 + 2,000 + 600 + 10 + 5`


2. 45.37

    | Digit | Place      | Value            |
    | ----- | ---------- | ---------------- |
    | 4     | Tens       | 4 × 10 = 40      |
    | 5     | Ones       | 5 × 1 = 5        |
    | 3     | Tenths     | 3 × 1/10 = 0.3   |
    | 7     | Hundredths | 7 × 1/100 = 0.07 |

    `45.37 = 40 + 5 + 0.3 + 0.07`
