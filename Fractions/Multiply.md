Question:


**I need to figure out how many apples to buy to feed 10 children. I'm going to cut every apple into 5 equal slices. Each child should get 4 of those slices**

10 is the number of children

4 Pieces for each child

5 Pieces per whole object

Each child can have $\frac{4}{5}$ apple, for 10 children it is $10 \times \frac{4}{5}$

### Different Paths to the Same Destination

$$10 \rarr \text{Total child}$$
$$5 \rarr \text{One whole object splitted pieces}$$
$$4 \rarr \text{Pieces for each child}$$

i believe even all give the same result, intuation for each path is different 

i'm trying to find the idea for each path


#### Method 1: Repeated addition

Each child can have $\frac{4}{5}$, total 10 children 

$$=\frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{5}$$

Since all are identical object we can do the fraction addition

$$=\frac{40}{5} = 8$$

Total i need 8 apples

#### Method 2: Scale Up then Scale down

Children count 10, each child can have 4 pieces so
$$\text{Total child} \times \text{Pieces for each child} = \text{Total pieces}$$
$$10 \times 4 = 40$$

Total i need 40 pieces, now we have to know how many apples we need

Each apple can cut or slice into 5 pieces

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}} = \text{Total whole object}$$

$$\frac{40}{5}=8$$

In this method we 1st calculate total pieces needed (scale up), then finding how many total object needed

1. **Scale Up to Total Pieces** : Ignore the splitting for a moment and just find the total number of small units (pieces) required from all children combined. 10 children×4 pieces/child=40 pieces.
2. **Scale Down to Total Objects** : Now, group those total required pieces into the size of a whole object (apples).

#### Method 3: Unit calculate and scale UP

$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}}=\text{Total whole object for 1 piece}$$

This step calculates the number of apples required if you were only giving 1 piece to each of the 10 children.
$$\frac{10}{5}=2$$

$$\text{Total whole object for 1 piece} \times \text{Actual needed Pieces for each child} = \text{Total whole object}$$

$$2 \times 4 = 8$$

If each child took 1 piece we need 2 apples, if each child took 4 pieces we need 8 apple

In this method we 1st calculate for base count for single unit, then scale up to no of actual pieces

1. **Unit Calculation** : Calculate the number of whole objects (apples) needed if you were only giving 1 piece to each of the 10 children. This is the Resource Density—the total objects required per single piece for all children.  

2. **Scale Up**: Since each child actually needs 4 pieces, multiply the "1-piece-per-child" apple count by 4. 2×4 pieces=8 apples.

#### Method 4: Percentage / Decimal

$$\frac{\text{Pieces for each child}}{\text{One whole object splitted pieces}} = \text{Percentage of one whole object for each cild}$$

$$\frac{4}{5}=0.8$$

$$\text{Total child} \times \text{Percentage of one whole object for each child} = \text{Total whole Object}$$

$$10 \times 0.8 = 8$$

1.  **Calculate the Factor**: Determine what fraction (or decimal/percentage) of one apple is needed per child.  $\frac{5}{4}=0.8$.

2. **Multiply by Total Unit**: Multiply the total number of children by the apple factor. $10 \times 0.8 = 8$

Question:

**8 Whole Apples, 4 Pieces per child, 5 pieces per apple, total child can fed?**

#### Method 1

$$\text{Whole Apples} \times \text{Pieces per apple} = \text{Total pieces}$$

$$8 \times 5 = 40$$

$$\frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Pieces per person}} =\text{ Total person}$$

$$\frac{40}{4} = 10$$

#### Method 2

$$\frac{\text{Pieces per person}}{\text{Pieces per apple}} = \text{Per person whole apple}$$

$$\frac{4}{5} \text{ in fraction}$$

$$\frac{\text{ Total whole apple}}{\frac{\text{Pieces per person}}{\text{Pieces per apple}}} = \text{Total person}$$

$$\frac{8}{\frac{4}{5}} = 10$$

If we devide $\frac{4}{5}$ of 8 apples we can feed 10 person

#### Method 3

>[!WARNING]  
> This method may confuse

$$\frac{\text{Total Apples}}{\text{Pieces per person}} = \text{Total person can feed for 1 piece}$$
Consider each apple is splitted into 1 piece so, 1 apple = 1 piece, 8 apple = 8 piece

$$\frac{8 \text{ piece of apple}}{4 \text{ piece per person}} = 2 \text{ Person can feed}$$

I have enough apples to feed 2 person

$$\text{Total person can feed for 1 piece} \times \text{Pieces per apple} =\text{ Total person}$$
$$2 \times 1 = 2$$
If slices per apple increase, people can feed also increase

It means that the total supply of 8 apple-pieces could only feed 2 people if the apples were not cut into smaller pieces (i.e., 1 apple = 1 piece). In other words, the total resource is 2 times the consumption rate.
$$2 \times 2 = 4\text{ person}$$

$$2 \times 3 = 6\text{ person}$$

$$\vdots$$

$$2 \times 5 = 10\text{ person}$$

**General Formula**

$$\frac{\text{Total resource}}{\text{Usage rate per unit}} = \text{Efficiency Factor}$$
Efficiency Factor = The Total potential groups or units that can be served before considering any division or slicing of the resource.


$$\text{Efficiency Factor} \times \text{Parts per resource} = \text{Total capacity}$$

Question:

**5 pieces per apple, total 8 apple, 10 child, no.of.slices per apple**


#### Method 1

$$\text{Pieces per apple} \times \text{Total apple} = \text{Total pieces}$$
$$5 \times 8 = 40$$

$$\frac{\text{Total Pieces}}{\text{Total child}} = \text{Pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{40}{10} = 4$$

#### Method 2

$$\frac{\text{Total apple}}{\text{Total child}} = \text{Apple per child }$$

$$\frac{8}{10}= 0.8$$

$$\text{Apple per child} \times \text{Slice per apple} = \text{Total slice per child}$$

$$0.8 \times 5 = 4$$

#### Method 3

$$\frac{\text{Total child}}{\text{Piece per apple}} = \text{Apples pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{10}{5} = 2$$

You have 2 children for every 1 slice a single apple provides

$$\frac{\text{Total Apple}}{\text{Apples pieces per child}} = \text{pieces per child}$$

$$\frac{8}{2}=4$$
