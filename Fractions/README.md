# Chapter 4: Fractions

## What is a Fraction?
A **fraction** is a way of showing parts of a whole.

### Why do we need fractions?
Sometimes we don’t use full things — we share or break them.

For example:

- If you cut **1 cake** into **4 equal pieces**, and take **1 piece**,  
  you didn’t eat the full cake — you ate **one-fourth** of it.

We write this as: $\frac{1}{4}$

### $$Fraction = \frac{Part taken}{Whole part}$$

A fraction has **two parts**:

| Part            | Name            | Meaning                                 |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Top number      | **Numerator**    | How many parts you have (counted)        |
| Bottom number   | **Denominator**  | How many equal parts the whole is split into |

Example:

$$
\frac{3}{5}
$$

This means **3 parts out of 5 equal parts**.

Imagine 1 chocolate bar cut into 5 equal blocks:

```
[■ ■ ■ □ □] -> You have 3 blocks out of 5 -> 3/5
```

### Visual Example (Cake)

- 1 cake is cut into 4 equal slices  
- You take 3 slices

Then:

$$
\frac{3}{4}
$$

So:
- **Numerator = 3** (slices taken)
- **Denominator = 4** (total slices)

### How do we read fractions?

| Fraction       | Read as        | Meaning                     |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| $\frac{1}{2}$ | one-half       | 1 part out of 2            |
| $\frac{2}{3}$ | two-thirds     | 2 parts out of 3           |
| $\frac{4}{5}$ | four-fifths    | 4 parts out of 5           |

### Important Note

Fractions only make sense when the pieces are **equal** in size.  
If they are **not equal**, it is **not a valid fraction**.

## Types of Fractions
There are **3 main types** of fractions:

### 1. Proper Fractions

A **Proper Fraction** is when the **numerator is smaller** than the denominator.

$$
\frac{3}{5}, \quad \frac{2}{7}, \quad \frac{1}{4}
$$

This means you have **less than one whole**.

Example:
- 1 cake is cut into 5 pieces, You take 3, You ate **3 out of 5**.

### 2. Improper Fractions

An **Improper Fraction** is when the **numerator is equal to or greater** than the denominator.

$$
\frac{5}{5}, \quad \frac{7}{4}, \quad \frac{9}{3}
$$

This means you have **one or more full wholes**.

Example:
- Pizza is cut into 4 slices. You ate 7 slices, That’s **1 full pizza and 3 more slices**.

### 3. Mixed Fractions (Mixed Numbers)

A **Mixed Fraction** shows a **whole number + a proper fraction**.

Example:

$$
1\frac{3}{4}, \quad 2\frac{1}{2}
$$

This means:
$$
 1\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{7}{4} 
$$
1 in the above means $\frac{4}{4}$ so you have $\frac{4}{4} + \frac{3}{4}$

$$
 2\frac{1}{2} = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
$$
2 in the above means $\frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$

### Why use Mixed Fractions?

Mixed numbers are easier to **understand in real life**.

Example:

- 1 cake and $\frac{3}{4}$ more = $(1\frac{3}{4})$

Instead of saying: “You ate $\frac{7}{4}$ cakes”, we say:\
“You ate $1\frac{3}{4}$ cakes”.
